### Keeping Your Personal Data
The Company will only keep your Personal Data for as long as it's necessary for the purposes spilled out in this Privacy Policy. We'll hold onto and use your Personal Data to the extent needed to follow our legal obligations (like, if we gotta keep your data to comply with applicable laws), sort out disputes, and enforce our legal agreements and policies.

The Company also hangs onto Usage Data for internal analysis purposes. Usage Data is usually kept for a shorter period, unless that data is used to beef up the security of our Service or boost its functionality, or if we're legally obliged to keep this data for longer.

### Transferring Your Personal Data
Your info (including Personal Data) gets processed at the Company's operating offices and any other spots where the parties involved in the processing are located. This means this info might get transferred to and stored on computers outside of your state, province, country, or other governmental jurisdiction, where data protection laws might differ from those in your neck of the woods.

By agreeing to this Privacy Policy and submitting such info, you're giving a big thumbs up to that transfer.

The Company will take all reasonably necessary steps to make sure your data is handled securely and in line with this Privacy Policy. We won't transfer your Personal Data to any org or country unless there are adequate controls in place, including top-notch security for your data and other personal info.

### Deleting Your Personal Data
You've got the right to delete or ask us for a hand in deleting the Personal Data we've collected about you.

Our Service might let you delete certain info about yourself right from within the Service.

You can always update, tweak, or delete your info by logging into your account (if you have one) and heading over to the account settings section that lets you manage your personal info. Or, you can just get in touch with us to request access, correction, or deletion of any personal info you've given us.

But heads up: we might need to hang onto some info when we've got a legal obligation or a lawful basis to do so.

### Disclosing Your Personal Data

#### Business Deals
If the Company gets involved in a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, your Personal Data might get transferred. We'll give you a heads-up before your Personal Data is transferred and becomes subject to a different Privacy Policy.

#### Law Enforcement
In certain situations, the Company might have to spill your Personal Data if it's required by law or in response to valid requests from public authorities (like a court or a government agency).

#### Other Legal Reasons
The Company might spill your Personal Data when it genuinely believes such action is necessary to:
-   Comply with a legal obligation
-   Protect and defend the rights or property of the Company
-   Prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing connected with the Service
-   Protect the personal safety of Service users or the public
-   Guard against legal liability

### Keeping Your Personal Data Safe
The security of your Personal Data is a big deal to us, but keep in mind that no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is ever 100% foolproof. While we totally bust our chops to use commercially acceptable ways to protect your Personal Data, we just can't guarantee its absolute security.

## Kiddo Privacy
Our Service isn't aimed at anyone under 13. We don't knowingly collect personally identifiable info from anyone under 13. If you're a parent or guardian and you know your kiddo has dished out Personal Data to us, please hit us up. If we discover we've snagged Personal Data from anyone under 13 without verified parental consent, we'll take steps to delete that info from our servers, pronto.

If we need to lean on consent as the legal basis for processing your info, and your country requires parental consent, we might ask for your parent's consent before we collect and use that info.

## Links to Other Websites
Our Service might feature links to other websites that we don't operate. If you click on a third-party link, you'll be whisked away to that third party's site. We seriously recommend you check out the Privacy Policy of every site you visit.

We have zero control over the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party websites or services, and we don't take any responsibility for 'em.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy
We might give our Privacy Policy a fresh look from time to time. We'll clue you in on any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy right here on this page.

Before changes go live, we'll give you a heads-up via email and/or a prominent notice on our Service, and we'll update that "Last Updated" date right at the top of this Privacy Policy.
