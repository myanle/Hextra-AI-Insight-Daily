- Email address
- Usage Data

#### Usage Data
Usage Data gets collected automatically when you're using the Service.

Usage Data might include stuff like your Device's Internet Protocol address (like your IP address), browser type and version, the pages you hit up on our Service, the time and date of your visit, how long you hung out on those pages, unique device identifiers, and other diagnostic data.

We may also snag information your browser sends our way whenever you visit our Service or jump on it via a mobile device.

### Tracking Technologies and Cookies
We use Cookies and similar tracking tech to keep tabs on activity on our Service and stash some info. The tracking tech we use includes beacons, tags, and scripts. These help us collect and track info, and generally make our Service better and help us analyze it. The tech we use might include:

- **Cookies or Browser Cookies**: A Cookie's just a tiny file that lands on your Device. You can tell your browser to ditch all Cookies or give you a heads-up when one's being sent. But hey, if you don't accept Cookies, you might miss out on some parts of our Service. Unless you've tweaked your browser settings to reject Cookies, our Service might still use 'em.
- **Web Beacons**: Some parts of our Service and our emails might have tiny electronic files called web beacons (also known as clear gifs, pixel tags, and single-pixel gifs). These let the Company, for example, count folks who've visited those pages or opened an email, and they're useful for other website stats (like seeing which sections are popular and making sure our systems and servers are all good).

Cookies can be "Persistent" or "Session" Cookies. Persistent Cookies chill out on your personal computer or mobile device even after you're offline, while Session Cookies vanish as soon as you close your web browser.

We use both Session and Persistent Cookies for the reasons listed below:

- **Necessary / Essential Cookies**
  - **Type**: Session Cookies
  - **Administered by**: Us
  - **Purpose**: These Cookies are absolutely vital for giving you the services available via the Website and letting you use some of its features. They help confirm who users are and stop sneaky, fraudulent use of user accounts. Without these Cookies, the services you've asked for simply can't be provided, and we only use these Cookies for those specific services.

- **Cookies Policy / Notice Acceptance Cookies**
  - **Type**: Persistent Cookies
  - **Administered by**: Us
  - **Purpose**: These Cookies are for figuring out if users have given the green light to use cookies on the Website.

The whole point of these Cookies is to give you a more personalized experience, so you don't have to punch in your preferences every single time you use the Website.

- **For other purposes**: We might use Your info for other things, like data analysis, spotting usage trends, figuring out how effective our promos are, and generally checking out and improving our Service, products, marketing, and your overall experience.

We might share Your personal information in these situations:

### Retention of Your Personal Data
The Company will hang onto Your Personal Data only for as long as it's necessary for the purposes we've laid out in this Privacy Policy. We'll keep and use Your Personal Data as much as needed to meet our legal obligations (like if we're required to keep your data by law), sort out any disputes, and enforce our legal agreements and policies.

The Company will also keep Usage Data for internal analysis. Usage Data usually sticks around for a shorter period, unless that data helps us beef up the security or improve the functionality of Our Service, or if we're legally on the hook to keep it longer.

### Transfer of Your Personal Data
Your information, including Personal Data, gets processed at the Company's main offices and anywhere else where the parties involved in the processing are located. This means this info might get shipped to and stored on computers outside your state, province, country, or other governmental area. Data protection laws in those spots might be different from yours.

Your agreement to this Privacy Policy, followed by you sending us such information, means you're cool with that transfer.

The Company will take all reasonable steps needed to make sure Your data is handled securely and in line with this Privacy Policy. No transfer of Your Personal Data will happen to an organization or a country unless there are proper safeguards in place, including for the security of Your data and other personal information.

### Delete Your Personal Data
You have the right to delete or ask us to help you delete the Personal Data we've collected about you.

Our Service might even let you delete certain info about yourself right from within the Service.

You can update, change, or delete your info anytime by logging into your Account (if you've got one) and heading to the account settings section where you can manage your personal information. You can also just hit us up to ask for access to, correct, or delete any personal info you've given us.

Just a heads-up, though: we might need to keep certain info if we've got a legal obligation or a valid reason to do so.

### Disclosure of Your Personal Data

#### Business Transactions
If the Company gets involved in a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, Your Personal Data might get transferred. We'll give you a heads-up before Your Personal Data is transferred and falls under a different Privacy Policy.

#### Law enforcement
In certain situations, the Company might have to spill Your Personal Data if the law demands it or if public authorities (like a court or a government agency) make a valid request.

#### Other legal requirements
The Company might disclose Your Personal Data if we genuinely believe it's necessary to:
- Play by the rules (legal obligations, that is)
- Protect and defend the Company's rights or property
- Prevent or investigate any potential shady business related to the Service
- Keep folks safe – that's users of the Service and the general public
- Guard against legal trouble

### Security of Your Personal Data
The security of Your Personal Data is a big deal to us, but remember, no method of sending data over the Internet or storing it electronically is 100% foolproof. While we work hard to use commercially acceptable ways to protect Your Personal Data, we can't promise it's absolutely, totally secure.

## Children's Privacy
Our Service isn't for anyone under 13. We don't knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone under 13. If you're a parent or guardian and you're aware that your child has given us Personal Data, please get in touch with us. If we find out that we've snagged Personal Data from anyone under 13 without checking for parental consent, we'll take steps to scrub that info from our servers.

If we need to rely on consent as the legal basis for processing your info, and your country requires parental consent, we might ask for your parent's permission before we collect and use that info.

## Links to Other Websites
Our Service might have links to other websites that aren't run by us. If you click on a third-party link, you'll be whisked away to that third party's site. We seriously recommend you check out the Privacy Policy of every site you visit.

We've got no control over, and don't take any responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.

## Changes to this Privacy Policy
We may update Our Privacy Policy from time to time. We'll let You know about any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy right here on this page.

We'll ping You via email and/or a clear notice on Our Service before the changes kick in, and we'll update the "Last updated" date at the top of this Privacy Policy.

You're advised to take a peek at this Privacy Policy now and then for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy become effective the moment they're posted on this page.
