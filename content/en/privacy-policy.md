This Privacy Policy lays out our game plan for how we collect, use, and share your info when you use our service. It also spills the tea on your privacy rights and how the law's got your back. 🛡️

Your personal data? We use it to power up and fine-tune our service. By using our service, you're giving us the thumbs up to collect and use your info just as this Privacy Policy says. 👍

## Explanations & Definitions

### Explanations
Capitalized words? They've got specific meanings, defined under the following conditions. Doesn't matter if they're singular or plural, these definitions hold true. No funny business! 😉

### Definitions
For the purpose of this Privacy Policy:

- **Account** means that unique spot we set up for you to get into our service, or bits of it. It's your digital key! 🔑

- **Affiliate**? That's any entity that's got control over us, we control, or that's under common control with us. And by "control," we're talking about owning 50% or more of shares, equity, or securities that can vote for directors or other management bodies. Basically, family businesses! 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦

- **Company** (yep, that's "the Company," "We," "Us," or "Our" in this whole agreement) points to **Yuan Si Wang AI Daily**. That's us! 👋

- **Cookies** are these tiny files a website tucks onto your computer, mobile, or whatever device you're using. They're packed with details like your browsing history on that site, for all sorts of uses. Kinda like digital breadcrumbs! 🍪

- **Country**? That's California, USA. Sunny vibes! ☀️

- **Device** means anything that can hop onto our service – think computers, phones, or even your snazzy digital tablet. If it connects, it counts! 💻📱

- **Personal Data** is basically any info that's tied to you, or could be used to figure out who you are. Your digital fingerprint, kinda. ✍️

- **Service**? That's just our website. Plain and simple! 🌐

- **Service Provider** is any person or company that crunches data for us. They're the third-party folks we hire to help run the service, do stuff on our behalf, or even help us figure out how people are using the service. Our behind-the-scenes helpers! 🤝

- **Usage Data** is that info we automatically scoop up, generated just by you using the service or from the service's tech itself. Think how long you spend on a page, stuff like that. It's automatic! 📊

- **Website** is **Hexi2077's AI Daily**, which you can check out at `https://yuansiwang.netlify.app/`. Bookmark it! ⭐

- **You**? That's either you, the awesome individual checking out or using our service, or the company or legal entity you're representing while doing so. Basically, it's about *you*! 😉

## Gathering & Using Your Personal Data

### Types of Data We Gather

#### Personal Data
When you're using our service, we might just ask for some personal info that helps us get in touch or figure out who you are. This 'personally identifiable information' could include, but isn't limited to: 🤫

- Email address
- Usage data

#### Usage Data
Usage Data? It's automatically scooped up as you cruise through our service. No effort required on your part! 🚀

Usage Data might include your device's IP address (think of it like your online home address), your browser type and version, which pages you visited on our service, when you visited, how long you hung out on those pages, unique identifiers for your device, and other techy diagnostic info. It's all about how you interact! 🕵️‍♀️

When you're hitting up our service on your mobile device, we might automatically collect some deets. This could include your mobile device type, its unique ID, its IP address, your mobile operating system, the kind of mobile browser you're using, unique device identifiers, and other diagnostic data. It’s all automatic, like magic! ✨

Your browser sends us info too, and we might collect that when you visit our service, whether you're on a desktop or going mobile. Every little bit helps! 🧐

### Tracking Tech & Cookies
We're using Cookies and other similar tracking tech to keep an eye on activity on our service and stash away certain info. These tracking tools include beacons, tags, and scripts, all designed to gather and track data, helping us seriously level up and analyze our service. The tech we use might include: 🕵️‍♂️

- **Cookies or Browser Cookies**: Think of a Cookie as a tiny file that lands on your device. You can tell your browser to kick all Cookies to the curb or to give you a heads-up when one's coming your way. But here’s the kicker: if you don’t accept Cookies, some parts of our service might not play nice. Unless you've already tweaked your browser settings to say "no thanks" to Cookies, our service might just go ahead and use 'em. Just giving you the lowdown! 😬
- **Web Beacons**: Some parts of our service and even our emails might have these tiny electronic files called web beacons (you might also hear them called clear GIFs, pixel tags, or single-pixel GIFs). These cool little tools let us, for example, count how many folks have visited those pages or opened an email, and help with other website stats. Think checking how popular a section is or making sure our systems are running smoothly. Pretty neat, right? ✨

Cookies can be either 'Persistent' or 'Session' Cookies. Persistent ones stick around on your computer or mobile even after you go offline, while Session Cookies vanish into thin air as soon as you close your web browser. Poof! 💨

We're rocking both Session and Persistent Cookies, and here's why: 👇

- **Necessary / Essential Cookies**
  - **Type**: Session Cookies
  - **Administered by**: Us
  - **Purpose**: These Cookies are absolutely vital for giving you the services available through our website and letting you use some of its cool features. They're like the bouncers at the club – they help verify who you are and stop any shady, fraudulent use of user accounts. Without these, the services you ask for simply wouldn't work, and we only use them to make sure those services get to you. No compromises here! 💪

- **Cookies Policy / Acceptance Cookies**
  - **Type**: Persistent Cookies
  - **Administered by**: Us
  - **Purpose**: These Cookies are basically our little reminder system to see if you've given us the green light to use Cookies on the website. Once you say yes, they remember it! ✅

- **Functionality Cookies**
  - **Type**: Persistent Cookies
  - **Administered by**: Us
  - **Purpose**: These Cookies are super helpful because they let us remember your choices when you're using the website. Think remembering your login info or your preferred language. The whole point of these Cookies is to give you a more personalized experience, so you don't have to keep re-entering your preferences every single time you visit. Smooth sailing! ⛵

Wanna know more about the Cookies we use and what choices you've got? No sweat! Just swing by our Cookies Policy or peep the Cookies section of this very Privacy Policy. All the deets are there! 🤓

- **To provide and maintain our Service**: This includes keeping tabs on how our service is being used. We're all about that uptime! 🛠️

This is for updates or info about features, products, or services you've signed up for – including security updates – whenever it's necessary or makes sense. We'll keep you in the loop! 📲
- **To provide You with news**: We love sharing! We might send you news, special offers, and general info about other cool stuff, services, and events we're offering that are similar to what you've already bought or asked about.

- **For business transfers**: Heads up! We might use your info to check out or go through with a merger, sale, restructure, or any other kind of asset transfer, whether it's business as usual or part of a bankruptcy. In these scenarios, the personal data we hold about our service users could be one of the assets changing hands. It's all about keeping our business agile! 🔄
- **For other purposes**: And hey, we might use your info for other stuff too! Think data analysis, spotting usage trends, figuring out if our promos are actually working, and generally boosting our service, products, marketing, and your overall experience. It's all to make things better for you! 🌟

We might share your personal info in these situations: 👇

- **With Service Providers**: We might share your personal info with our Service Providers to help us keep an eye on how our service is being used and to get in touch with you. They're part of the team! 👨‍💻
- **For business transfers**: During any merger talks, asset sales, financing rounds, or when another company buys all or part of our business, we might share or transfer your personal info. It's par for the course in big business moves! 💼

Our Affiliates include our parent company, any other subsidiaries, joint venture partners, or other companies we control or are under common control with. It's a family affair! 🏡
- **With Business Partners**: We might team up with our business partners and share your info to bring you some cool products, services, or promos. It's all about more good stuff for you! ✨
- **With other users**: If you're sharing personal info or just chatting it up with other users in public areas, just know that info could be seen by everyone and even shared outside. So, share wisely! 🗣️
- **With Your consent**: And if you give us the green light, we might share your personal info for any other reason you agree to. Your permission, our action! 👍

### Keeping Your Personal Data
The Company will only keep your Personal Data for as long as we absolutely need it for the purposes laid out in this Privacy Policy. We'll hold onto and use your data as much as needed to meet our legal duties (like if the law says we have to keep it), sort out any spats, and enforce our agreements and policies. We're not hoarders, promise! 📦

The Company will also hang onto Usage Data for our internal analysis. Usage data usually gets tossed after a short while, unless it's being used to supercharge our service's security, boost its features, or if we're legally required to keep it longer. We keep it lean! ⏱️

### Transferring Your Personal Data
Your info (yep, that includes your Personal Data) gets processed at the Company's main offices and wherever else the folks doing the processing are located. This means your info might get shipped off to, and stored on, computers outside of your state, province, country, or even other government jurisdictions. Data protection laws in those places might be totally different from yours, just so you know! 🌍

By saying 'yes' to this Privacy Policy and sending over your info, you're totally cool with that transfer. Got it? 👍

The Company is gonna take every reasonable step to make sure your data is handled securely and totally in line with this Privacy Policy. We won't be sending your Personal Data to any organization or country unless we're sure they've got solid controls in place, including top-notch security for your data and other personal info. Your data's safety is our priority! 🔒

### Deleting Your Personal Data
You've got the right to delete, or ask for our help in deleting, any Personal Data we've collected about you. It's your data, your rules! 🚮

Our service might even let you zap certain info about yourself right from within the service. Easy peasy! ✨

You can update, change, or delete your info anytime by logging into your Account (if you've got one) and heading over to the account settings section where you can manage your personal stuff. Or hey, just hit us up directly to ask for access, correction, or deletion of any personal info you've given us. We're here to help! 🤳

Just a quick heads-up though: we might need to hang onto some info if we've got a legal duty or a legit reason to do so. It's not personal, it's business (or law)! ⚖️

### Disclosing Your Personal Data

#### Business Transactions
If the Company ever gets into a merger, acquisition, or an asset sale, your Personal Data might be transferred. We'll give you a heads-up before your Personal Data gets moved and falls under a different privacy policy. Transparency is key! 🔑

#### Law Enforcement
Under certain circumstances, the Company might have to spill your Personal Data if the law demands it, or if a public authority (like a court or government agency) sends a valid request. We gotta play by the rules! 👮‍♀️

#### Other Legal Requirements
The Company might also show your Personal Data if we genuinely believe it's necessary to: 👇

- Comply with a legal obligation
- Protect and defend the rights or property of the Company
- Prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing in connection with the Service
- Protect the personal safety of Users of the Service or the public
- Protect against legal liability

### The Security of Your Personal Data
The security of your Personal Data is super important to us! But let's be real: no method of sending stuff over the internet or storing it electronically is 100% foolproof. While we bust our tails using commercially acceptable ways to shield your Personal Data, we just can't give a rock-solid guarantee of its absolute security. We're doing our best! 🛡️

## Kids' Privacy
Our Service isn't aimed at anyone under 13 years old. We totally don't knowingly collect any personally identifiable info from kids under 13. If you're a parent or guardian and you know your child has given us Personal Data, please hit us up! If we ever find out we've collected Personal Data from anyone under 13 without verified parental consent, we'll quickly wipe that info from our servers. Kids' safety first! 👶🚫

If we ever need to lean on consent as the legal reason for processing your info, and your country requires a parent's OK, we might just ask for your parent's permission before we scoop up and use that data. Gotta follow the rules! 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦

## Links to Other Websites
Our Service might have links to other websites that we don't run. If you click on a third-party link, bam! You'll be whisked away to that third-party's site. We seriously recommend you check out the privacy policy of every single website you visit. Stay safe out there! 🔗

We've got zero control over, and take no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services. What happens there, stays there (with them)! 🙅‍♀️

## Changes to This Privacy Policy
We might tweak our Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we'll let you know about any changes by simply posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. Easy peasy update! 🔄

Before any big changes kick in, we'll give you a heads-up via email and/or a super noticeable announcement on our service. Plus, we'll update that 'Last updated' date right at the top of this Privacy Policy. No surprises! 🔔

You're smart, so we recommend you check this Privacy Policy regularly for any tweaks. Changes to this Privacy Policy are officially 'on' the moment they're posted on this page. Stay informed! 🤓
