### Today's AI News

1.  **AI Search Engines and Model Services** are seeing fresh breakthroughs, with a sharp focus on the education market and developer demands. **Perplexity AI Search Engine** is now giving its Perplexity Pro advanced service to 264 million students globally for free for two years, offering citation research, in-depth reports, and interactive AI apps, clearly aiming for the student market. **ima's web version** has officially launched, making it super easy for users to access the knowledge base anytime, anywhere. **TRAE.ai** rolled out custom model service provider **Kimi** and the **Kimi-K2** model, also supporting the **Grok-4 (Beta)** super model. These boast strong coding abilities and general agent task processing, making them handy for programmers. **AI application scenarios** keep expanding, and user experience is constantly getting better, though this also brings potential risks like academic integrity issues. **Developers' demand** for model diversity and professionalism is steadily climbing. ‚ú®
2.  **The AI Era** is here, bringing fierce competition among giants and a truckload of hidden worries. **Google's AI summary feature** in Discover is hitting news website traffic hard, posing a massive challenge for news publishers. **OpenAI's rapid expansion** comes with issues like team duplication, messy codebases, and security concerns, even raising questions about how much they truly prioritize safety. **Meta** just patched a serious AI security vulnerability, once again highlighting the security and privacy risks that come with AI tech's blistering pace. **AI technology's lightning-fast development** offers both opportunities and challenges. We really need to pay attention to its downsides, actively look for coping strategies, and make sure AI tech develops safely, reliably, and responsibly, tackling issues like AI security, data privacy, and its impact on traditional industries. üò¨‚ö°
3.  **Elon Musk's Grok 'Miss' and WAIC 2025**: It's an AI party with a side of deep reflection. **Elon Musk's AI chatbot Grok** just rolled out a new "smart companion" feature, letting users pick anime or cartoon characters for interaction, which has sparked a lot of chatter. **Some users** aren't thrilled with the character designs, but plenty of others are giving props to its personalized interaction attempt. **Tests** show the Ani character's Chinese dialogue has some glitches, though its 3D animation effects are top-notch. **The 2025 World Artificial Intelligence Conference (WAIC)** is set to focus on AI empowering smart terminals, diving into AI applications and challenges in smartphones, smart glasses, smart cars, and showcasing the latest in embodied intelligent robots and smart driving. **AI tech** is evolving super fast, so we need to be wary of ethical and social issues. For instance, AI companions could lead people to get lost in virtual worlds, and there are data security and privacy protection concerns too. **AI tech development** should really be human-centered, balancing both progress and safety. üí¨üí®üòµ‚Äçüí´
4.  **AI Music Tech** is hitting new highs, with a 'Time Machine' App and a slick AI model optimization tool leading the way. **Rewind: Music Time Travel music app** lets users jam to tunes from different eras. **NVIDIA** dropped the **NeMo Agent Toolkit Profiler**, which helps supercharge AI model performance. **Walmart's internally developed Element AI platform** lets engineers whip up AI applications fast, supporting various cloud platforms and data centers, and it can even auto-pick the most cost-effective open-source models. üé∂üöÄ
5.  **The Gemini Large Language Model's 'IQ' Mystery**: Does praise mess with its performance? **Reddit user gullydowny** shared a wild interaction with **Google's Gemini Large Language Model**, noticing that while Gemini corrected his previous errors, its performance seemed to dip after getting praised. **This** has sparked questions about whether **AI models** truly get praise and if it affects their performance, hinting that current **Large Language Models** still need to level up their game in understanding human emotions and handling feedback. **This** makes you wonder how we can better interact with **AI tools** to really unleash their full potential. ü§Ø‚¨ÜÔ∏è
