2.  **Meta** and **NYU** have just unveiled some groundbreaking research, revealing a way to achieve "**selective forgetting**" in **large models** by precisely manipulating **Transformer attention heads**. 🧠💡 This "**AI Amnesia**" technique uses **SAMD** and **SAMI** to fine-tune **AI**'s knowledge storage like a mixing board. It's not just about deleting specific concepts, like "dogs bark," but also boosting math reasoning, adjusting safety modules, and even influencing visual model recognition! This breakthrough ushers in the "**editable era**" for **large models**, sparking fresh thinking about **AI explainability** and **safety boundaries**. ✨

Users are hopping onto **ChatGPT** or **Douyin** effects to upload their childhood pics and predict what they'll look like grown up. 📸👴👵 While the **AI**'s predictions are super fun, they're not always spot-on, sometimes showing "**AI hallucinations**" or just not meeting expectations. Still, as a cool entertainment app, it's totally crushing it in popularity and getting tons of people involved! 🤣

2.  **Yangyi** has observed something pretty cool: developers are already building **MultiAgent** systems based on **Claudecode**! 👨‍💻🔗 This system smartly manages contextual conversations via **Markdown** files, creating a neat **MVP** solution for parallel multi-agent processing right in **VSCode**. He's super hyped about this approach and guesses that with "24/7 non-stop engineers" on the job, the tech will mature really fast. Though, the nitty-gritty of cross-terminal hooks still needs some exploration. 💡

5.  **Sam (OpenAI)** has reportedly delayed the release of an upcoming open-source model 🤫. According to **K2 (Yuchen Jin)**, it wasn't because of **Kimi**. Nope, the real reason is that this powerful model, despite having parameters far less than 1T, hit a snag – a "ridiculous" or "rookie" error was discovered right before launch, causing the postponement. Talk about a facepalm moment! 🤦‍♀️ [More Details](https://x.com/op7418/status/1944254013408784624)

6.  **Yangyi** just dropped a demo of a **100% code project** entirely generated by **AI (Claude)** in just **6 hours**! 🚀 This really hammers home **AI**'s powerful processing capabilities in non-cutting-edge fields. He points out that once **AI** drastically boosts productivity, the scramble for traffic will intensify. So, human-AI collaborative automated systems need to jump in and seize the market fast, creating assets with serious leverage. 🔥 Check it out: [More Details](https://x.com/Yangyixxxx/status/1944252584950374435)
