3.  🎉 Big congrats! The AI security team from South China University of Technology's School of Computer Science recently teamed up with folks from Johns Hopkins and UC San Diego, and they've totally cracked the code on fending off **malicious poisoning attacks** in **federated learning**! They've come up with some game-changing defense methods: **FedID** and **Scope**. 👏 These groundbreaking findings have already snagged spots in top-tier journals like **AI powerhouse TPAMI 2025** and cybersecurity giant **TIFS 2025**, proving they're no joke! **FedID** can sniff out malicious gradients using a combo of metrics and dynamic weighting, while **Scope** cleverly uses dimension-wise normalization and differential scaling to expose and fight back against constrained backdoor dimensions. This seriously beefs up the **security and robustness** of **federated learning**! 🔒🛡️['论文地址'](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11045524) ['代码链接'](https://github.com/siquanhuang/Multi-metrics_against_backdoors_in_FL)

### **AI Industry Outlook & Societal Impact**

1.  Alright, grab your popcorn! 🍉 **Lu Liu** and **Allan Jabri**, two key OpenAI researchers who spearheaded the **GPT-4o image generation feature**, just jumped ship to Meta. Talk about a major "talent exodus" in the AI world! 🚶‍♀️🚶‍♂️ This move not only underscores OpenAI's ongoing **talent bleed** woes since the whole Sam Altman drama, but it also screams that Meta is on an aggressive **poaching spree** to fast-track its **super-intelligence dreams**. No doubt, this is gonna shake up the **AI competitive landscape** big time! 💥

### **Social Scoops**

1.  Right now, AI models like **Claude Code** and other **agents** are still chewing through a ton of **tokens** just to boost their success rates. It's kinda like the "dumb way" – just keep trying until it works. 😅 But hey, this seemingly "clunky" strategy actually hints that the real **era of AI efficiency** might be just around the corner – maybe even within six months! 🤯 ['more details'](https://x.com/Yangyixxxx/status/1944029058171314602)
2.  Mind blown! 😲 **Kimi K2** going open-source has totally spilled the beans on the sheer power of the **MuonClip optimizer**! It's successfully scaled **LLM** training to **trillions of parameters** and pulled off astonishingly stable training on **15.5 *trillion* tokens**. This absolutely flips our understanding of massive model training on its head! 😱 This also signals a quiet shift in the AI industry's tech review process; we're definitely moving from the "Billion-parameter era" into a confident "Trillion-parameter era"! 🚀['more details'](https://x.com/op7418/status/1943993841402753123)
    <br/> ![Kimi K2与MuonClip](https://cdn.jsdmirror.com/gh/justlovemaki/imagehub@main/assets/2025/07/news_01jzzkbc5pem8t9cg32p7esk5m.jpeg) <br/>

3.  No way, that's nuts! 🤯 **Kimi K2** is showing off some seriously powerful **front-end generation capabilities**. It can perfectly handle gnarly page logic and animations, and get this: it can even easily step in for the **Claude Code** model, giving you a super cost-effective development experience with zero risk of getting your account banned! 👍 This definitely fills a huge void for **open-source models** in China when it comes to **practical engineering applications**, and it's totally boosting developers' faith in **homegrown large models**! 💪['more details'](https://m.okjike.com/originalPosts/687203b9e81ba2a179da0925)
4.  Xinzhiyuan shared an awesome blog post, highly touted by **Karpathy**, that really hammered home one core idea: **AI** is an **engineer's superpower amplifier**, but how well it works ultimately boils down to an engineer's solid **coding chops**, killer **prompts**, and top-notch **software engineering practices**. 💻 👨‍💻 The article breaks down how to cleverly use AI to supercharge development, debugging, learning, doc generation, and code reviews. It also takes a fresh look at software engineering principles in the AI age, putting a huge spotlight on how **testing** is totally non-negotiable! 🤔 Man, that's a real gut check for all engineers! ['more details'](https://x.com/hongming731/status/1943857272964493417)
    <br/> ![AI工程师能力放大](https://cdn.jsdmirror.com/gh/justlovemaki/imagehub@main/assets/2025/07/news_01jzzkbnabfxh932p8ggnbexv1.jpeg) <br/>
5.  **Andrew Ng**, in his latest YC talk, dropped some serious wisdom: the secret sauce to crushing it in **AI entrepreneurship** is all about **execution speed**! 🚀 He figures that thanks to **AI coding assistants**, you can crank out prototypes ten times faster or more. That means the bottleneck for startups isn't really about nailing the tech anymore, it's shifted to **product management** and nailing that **user feedback loop**! 🔄 He also specifically emphasized that deeply understanding **AI building blocks** (like agent workflows, RAG, and fine-tuning) is central to carving out a competitive edge. Oh, and Ng also urged everyone to chill out on the over-hyped "AI is dangerous" narratives and actively protect the **open-source ecosystem**. Seriously, that whole talk was a total mic drop! 💡['more details'](https://x.com/hongming731/status/1943856893124129024)
