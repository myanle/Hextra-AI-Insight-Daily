4.  **OmniPart** is a novel part-aware 3D object generation framework. It achieves high semantic disentanglement and strong structural cohesion by breaking down complex generation tasks into two stages: structural planning and synchronized part synthesis. This method allows users to define part granularity, precisely localize elements, and supports diverse downstream applications, paving the way for generating more interpretable, editable, and versatile 3D content. üß©

5.  **This research** introduces the "coding triad" framework, designed to systematically evaluate the programming capabilities of large language models (**LLMs**) in code comprehension. While LLMs can form self-consistent systems, their solutions often lack the diversity and robustness of human-generated code, with errors frequently stemming from training data biases. The study indicates that combining human-generated materials and model fusion can significantly enhance LLM performance and robustness, also shedding light on the consistencies and inconsistencies in LLM cognition, thereby guiding the development of more powerful coding models in the future. üí°
