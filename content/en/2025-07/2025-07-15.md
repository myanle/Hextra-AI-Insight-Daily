1.  **Meta**, teaming up with a top-notch research crew from **UC Berkeley**, just rolled out **StreamDiT**‚Äîa game-changing **AI model** that can generate **frame-by-frame, real-time video streams**. Running on just **one high-end GPU**, it whips up smooth 512p videos at 16 frames per second, and its dynamic video handling is mind-blowing, blowing away current tech. **StreamDiT** pulls off this feat thanks to its unique **custom architecture** and a **key acceleration technique** that slashes computation steps from 128 to a mere **8**. This breakthrough hints at a massive future for **real-time interactive video content creation**, and while it still has a few quirks with video memory, it's definitely an exciting frontier in **AI News**.
2.  **Tsinghua University** and **Tencent HunyuanX team**'s latest research has some cool **AI News** for us: They found that in **multimodal large models**, less than 5% of attention heads (dubbed **"visual heads"**) are actually handling the heavy lifting of **visual content understanding**. This wild discovery of **visual head sparsity** is like a compass guiding model optimization. Based on this, the team unveiled **SparseMM**, a method that intelligently allocates cache resources. It not only keeps performance top-notch but also boosts inference speed by an insane **1.87 times** and cuts **peak memory usage** by **52%**. This totally opens up new avenues for efficient **multimodal large model** deployment, making us super excited for future **AI Daily Reports**! Check out the full scoop here: [Paper Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05344).
