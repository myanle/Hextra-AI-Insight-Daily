### **AI Product & Feature Updates**

1.  **WeChat Pay** just dropped its game-changing **MCP** (Merchant Commerce Platform) feature, and wow, it's essentially paving a "highway" for AI app commercialization! 🚀 This brilliant move lets AI complete payments directly during user interactions, which not only streamlines the payment process and boosts conversion rates but also cleverly builds a closed data loop. This allows AI to adjust services in real-time, even turning revenue into a data source, which fuels the **self-learning** and scenario expansion of AI business models. Talk about killing a few birds with one stone! 💰🧠

2.  **Meta** is quietly testing out some "more proactive" **chatbots** across its popular apps, **Facebook Messenger** and **WhatsApp**. These bots are pretty smart, designed to remember your preferences and even strike up conversations with you! While this move could definitely deepen user engagement with AI and rake in some serious revenue, let's not forget to keep a sharp eye on the potential **security risks** involved. 👀💰

### **Cutting-Edge AI Research**

1.  German AI consulting firm TNG has just unleashed a beast of an AI model: **DeepSeek R1T2 Chimera**! This model brilliantly fuses the DeepSeek V3, R1, and R1-0528 models, leveraging a super cool "**Architectures of Experts (AoE) technique**." What's mind-blowing is that it's even faster and more powerful than the official R1! This **open-source model**, with weights available on Hugging Face, is poised to strike the **perfect balance** between speed, intelligence, and output efficiency. Seriously, it's got us super excited! 🚀 For more, check out the [Model Link](https://huggingface.co/tngtech/DeepSeek-TNG-R1T2-Chimera) and [Paper Link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.14794).

3.  wwwgoubuli shared an innovative method for **deep collaboration with AI**. Instead of directly asking AI for answers, he first gets AI to help sort out and refine his verbally unclear or messy questions. This "letting AI organize questions" model not only provides better context for subsequent real answers, but even more magically, users can sometimes find the answers to their own puzzles while the AI is helping them clarify! Seriously, how smart is that?! 🤯 Learn [More Details](https://x.com/wwwgoubuli/status/1940974712055910818).

4.  Tom Huang gave us an exciting peek into the future development of **Refly AI's creative canvas**! 🎨 He envisions that if it could integrate **multimodal generation capabilities** (like generating images, videos, and audio) and combine with multimodal understanding models like **Gemini**, it would vastly enrich content creation and help build even more captivating stories. This definitely signals the massive potential for AI creative tools in multimodal integration. The future looks bright! ✨ Get [More Details](https://x.com/tuturetom/status/1940943363898834947).

6.  Baoyu just dropped a golden nugget of wisdom from **Andrew Ng** on how to efficiently develop an **MVP** using **AI**! 💡 Ng emphasizes that when time is tight, you should absolutely **slash the project scope** until it can be completed quickly. This way, you can swiftly launch, validate ideas, and get feedback fast. He uses his own experience developing a **virtual audience simulator** as a vivid example, illustrating how this "**fast start**" approach helps developers overcome procrastination, rapidly master new skills, and accelerate product iteration. It's truly a godsend for entrepreneurs! ✨ Grab [More Details](https://x.com/dotey/status/1940868768948760613).

7.  Baoyu, responding to dontbesilent's advice to "just ask **AI** if you don't know," hit the nail on the head regarding a common sticking point for many: not knowing **how to clearly phrase a question**! 🤔 He stressed that in interacting with AI, "**asking the question**" is often more challenging than "answering the question," profoundly revealing the crucial role of **questioning ability** in effective **AI interaction**. Looks like if we want AI to be a big help, we've gotta learn to ask the right questions first! 🎯 Check out [More Details](https://x.com/dotey/status/1940845834373157125).
