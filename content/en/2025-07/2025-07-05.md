### **AI Product & Feature Updates**

1.  **WeChat Pay** recently rolled out its innovative **MCP** feature, and let me tell you, it's practically an "expressway" for commercializing AI applications! 🚀 This cool new tool lets AI handle payments directly while interacting with users. Not only does it super-simplify the payment process and skyrocket conversion rates, but it also brilliantly creates a closed data loop. This means AI can adjust its services in real-time and even convert revenue into a data source, fueling the **self-learning** and scenario expansion of AI business models. Talk about hitting multiple targets with one shot! ✨

2.  **Meta** is currently doing some stealthy testing of "more proactive" **chatbots** on its popular apps, **Facebook Messenger** and **WhatsApp**. 🤖 These bots are pretty next-level – they can actually remember your preferences and actively strike up a convo! While this move could totally deepen user engagement with AI and rake in some serious dough, let's not forget the potential **security risks** you'll wanna watch out for. Just sayin'! 😬

### **AI Cutting-Edge Research**

1.  German AI consulting firm TNG just dropped a seriously "beast mode" AI model called **DeepSeek R1T2 Chimera**! 🧪 By cleverly mashing up DeepSeek V3, R1, and R1-0528, and rocking that slick "**Assembly of Experts (AoE) technology**," it's actually faster and more powerful than the official R1 model! 🔥 This **open-source model**, with its weights available on Hugging Face, is totally set to find that **sweet spot** between speed, smarts, and output efficiency. So, yeah, it's got us hyped! 🚀 For more info, hit up the [Model Address](https://huggingface.co/tngtech/DeepSeek-TNG-R1T2-Chimera) and [Paper Address](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.14794).

3.  wwwgoubuli just dropped an **innovative way to collaborate deeply with AI**! 🤔 Instead of just asking AI for answers directly, he first gets AI to help sort out and refine his own muddled or poorly articulated questions. This "let AI organize the problem" approach doesn't just provide way better context for the real answers later; what's even wilder is that users can sometimes figure out the answers to their own conundrums *during* the refining process! Seriously brilliant! ✨🤯 [More Details](https://x.com/wwwgoubuli/status/1940974712055910818)

4.

5.  @wwwgoubuli just dropped a sharp take on Wang Shuyi's question, blunt-forcing his frustration with some "teachers" in the current AI coding scene who are spouting nonsense. 👨‍💻 He figures that **senior programmers** who are genuinely deep into **AI programming** wouldn't even *think* of reaching similar conclusions, let alone bother to comment. This really highlights the extreme importance of **practical experience** when it comes to understanding AI-assisted coding, and it seriously hit home for a lot of devs out there! 💬🤔 [More Details](https://x.com/wwwgoubuli/status/1940942626473365908)

6.  Baoyu just shared **Andrew Ng's** "golden nugget" on how to efficiently crank out **MVPs** with **AI**! 💡 He pointed out that when you're short on time, you should absolutely, without hesitation, **drastically slash your project scope** until it's something you can nail down super fast. This lets you launch quickly, validate your ideas, and grab feedback ASAP. 🚀 Andrew Ng himself, using his experience developing a **virtual audience simulator** as an example, brilliantly explained how this "**sprint to launch**" method helps developers beat procrastination, pick up new skills on the fly, and speed up product iterations. Honestly, it's a godsend for any entrepreneur! 🏃‍♀️ [More Details](https://x.com/dotey/status/1940868768948760613)

7.  Baoyu, weighing in on dontbesilent's "just ask **AI** if you don't know" advice, totally hit the nail on the head about the real bottleneck many people face: not knowing **how to clearly articulate the problem**! 🤔 He stressed that when you're interacting with AI, the challenge of "**asking the right questions**" is often way bigger than "**answering questions**." This profoundly highlights the crucial role of **questioning ability** in effective **AI interaction**. Looks like if we want AI to be a game-changer, we gotta learn to ask the *right* questions first! 💬💡 [More Details](https://x.com/dotey/status/1940845834373157125)
