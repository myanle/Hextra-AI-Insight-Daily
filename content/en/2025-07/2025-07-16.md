3.  **MIRIX's** performance is an absolute game-changer, a total dimension-shifter! üí• In complex multi-modal understanding tasks, MIRIX‚Äôs accuracy crushes traditional RAG methods by 35%, while its storage overhead unbelievably drops by a whopping 99.9%! Compared to simply "stuffing" long texts, its performance skyrockets by 410%. And in multi-turn conversation tasks, it effortlessly outpaces all existing models with an 85.4% score, as if AI suddenly had an epiphany and gained super-powered "recall abilities." ü§Ø This isn't just a performance boost; it signals a fundamental leap for AI from "dialogue generation" to a mind driven by long-term memory, heralding a smarter, more understanding AI era. This is definitely the highlight of the latest AI news!

4.  What‚Äôs even more surprising is that **MIRIX** isn't just stuck in the lab; the team also launched a personal assistant app for Mac! ‚ú® Now, anyone can use this out-of-the-box app to truly let AI "see what you see, understand what you do," transforming bits of your digital life into lasting electronic memories and completely waving goodbye to AI's "forgetfulness." This is undeniably a landmark breakthrough in AI development, making the idea of AI having a "proto-mind" not just sci-fi, but a tangible reality. Curious to dive deeper?

5.  **The existing evaluation methods for Large Reasoning Models (LRMs)** are practically ancient history! üßê They just test models one question at a time, which means models can easily "cheat" their way through or their true capabilities in complex multi-task scenarios are never really measured. To fix this, researchers have unleashed a "boot camp" ‚Äì the **REST** framework ‚Äì specifically designed to stress-test LRMs. üî• It can throw multiple questions at once, simulating real-world scenarios where AI has to "juggle many things at once." This is undoubtedly a significant advancement in the AI news sphere.

6.  **The test results** are jaw-dropping: even top-tier models claiming to be SOTA, like DeepSeek-R1, see their performance plummet under REST's "interrogation"‚Äîit was a huge "fail" moment! üìâ This shows that REST is far better than traditional benchmarks at "seeing through" and revealing the real differences between models. The research also pinpointed AI's "overthinking trap" as the culprit behind performance drops, while models trained with "long2short" techniques showed much better "resilience." üí™ Looks like REST won't just help us evaluate AI more accurately; it'll also point the way for future AI R&D, saving us from wasting money on manually labeling "useless questions." This is seriously big AI news! [AI News: REST Framework Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10541)
