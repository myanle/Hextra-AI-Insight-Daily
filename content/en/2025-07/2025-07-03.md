2.  **Zhipu AI** recently dropped a bombshell! 🤯 They've **open-sourced** **GLM-4.1V-Thinking**, a new generation general-purpose visual model based on the GLM-4V architecture. This model is super powerful, with its newly added **Chain-of-Thought reasoning mechanism** significantly boosting its ability to handle complex cognitive tasks. It has also performed exceptionally well in multiple authoritative evaluations! 💪 Supporting various modal inputs like images and videos, its performance surpasses many models of similar or even larger parameters. What's even more exciting is that it offers **free commercial licensing**! 💰 So, global developers, what are you waiting for? Head over to the [Project Address](https://huggingface.co/) and check it out! ✨

3.  China Media Group (CMG) is about to make some noise! 📢 At 10:30 AM on July 6th, they'll be live-streaming the first **robot dog task competition** as part of the **World Robot Skills Competition**! Get ready for some serious action as the super cool '**Black Panther 2.0**' robot dog tackles extreme tasks, even performing a thrilling **100-meter human-machine showdown**! 🤯 This competition isn't just for kicks; it's designed to fully assess robot dogs' comprehensive capabilities in **extreme emergency rescue environments** like fires and earthquakes. It's expected to push further development in this field, helping keep us all safe! 💪
    <br/> ![Robot Dog Close-up](https://cdn.jsdmirror.com/gh/justlovemaki/imagehub@main/images/2025/07/news_01k02396fnf1n820mf5vhmhvd9.avif)](https://cdn.jsdmirror.com/gh/justlovemaki/imagehub@main/images/2025/07/news_01k02396fnf1n820mf5vhmhvd9.avif) <br/>

4.  A brand-new paper diving deep into the cognitive foundations and societal impacts of **Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)** just dropped! 🤯 It argues that true intelligence goes way beyond the limitations of current **token prediction models**, requiring the integration of **modular reasoning**, **persistent memory**, and **multi-agent coordination**. The paper highlights that the **Agentic RAG framework** combined with a **deep integration of memory and reasoning** is the key path towards general intelligence. Of course, the paper also frankly points out the **scientific, technical, and ethical challenges** facing AGI's realization. The future looks promising, but challenges definitely abound! 🎢 [Paper Address](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00951)

### AI Industry Outlook & Social Impact
1.  Amazon CEO Andy Jassy recently sent a clear signal: 😬 As **AI technology** rapidly advances, Amazon is likely to face more **layoffs** in the future! This isn't just talk; AI is pushing the automation of **office and warehouse jobs**, naturally reducing the need for human staff. But don't despair just yet! Amazon is actively investing at least **$20 billion** to build **AI data centers** and is aggressively hiring more **AI and robotics talent**. 🤔 This move is probably to adapt to technological change, and also to free up employees from repetitive tasks so they can focus on more creative work. Fingers crossed! 🤞

2.  A recent investigation just dropped a jaw-dropping bombshell! 🤯 Apparently, papers from at least **14 top universities worldwide** have been 'secretly' embedded with **AI-readable hidden instructions**, designed to trick **AI reviewers** into boosting their scores! 🎓 This revelation immediately stirred up a massive storm concerning **academic integrity** and '**prompt injection**' attacks. 🚨 Not only does this seriously jeopardize the fairness of academic peer review, but it also forces the academic community and governments globally to fast-track the development of stricter **AI usage guidelines** to tackle these potential risks. Time to get serious! ⏱️

5.  Huang Yun, drawing from Min Choi's experience, dropped the **three core strategies** for rockin' Twitter (𝕏)! 🚀 First up: consistent daily updates and 'riding the coattails' of bigger accounts. Second: actively engaging in 'mutual business praise' to boost exposure. And finally: cleverly using **AI** (like Grok or ChatGPT) as a content consultant. He stresses that on social media, **content and personal influence** are way more valuable than direct revenue sharing, as they open up broader networking and brand opportunities. Wise words! 🧠

6.  Meng Shao shared a sharp insight from a16z, highlighting that **AI** is totally reshaping the programming world through **large language models**! 🤯 This isn't just about boosting development efficiency; it's also lowering the entry barrier for newcomers, potentially adding hundreds of billions of dollars in value to the global developer market. This means future **software development** won't be about endlessly searching Stack Overflow for answers, but rather collaborating with AI. Developers will focus more on expressing intent and learning on the fly, not getting replaced. How exciting is that?! ✨

7.  Baoyu's blog post takes a deep dive, dissecting the subtle differences between **Prompt**, **Prompt Engineering**, and **Context Engineering**! 🧠 He explains that a **prompt** is simply an 'instruction' given to an AI model. **Prompt engineering**, on the other hand, is the systematic process of designing, testing, and optimizing these instructions. Then there's **context engineering**, which he describes as the art and science of providing large language models with the right information and tools to complete tasks most efficiently – a crucial 'internal skill,' especially for **AI Agents**! Fascinating stuff, right? 🤔
