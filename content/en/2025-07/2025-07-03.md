7. Baoyu's blog post dives deep into the subtle differences between **Prompts**, **Prompt Engineering**, and **Context Engineering**! ｧ He explains that a **prompt** is simply the 'instruction' given to an AI model; **prompt engineering** is the systematic process of designing, testing, and optimizing these instructions; and **context engineering**, well, that's the art and science of providing Large Language Models with the right information and tools to complete tasks most efficiently. For an **AI Agent** especially, this is like super crucial 'inner power'! 庁屏・・
