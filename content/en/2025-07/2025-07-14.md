2.  ChatGPT just proved its legal chops when a Reddit user leveraged it to uncover a decade-long, $5 million inheritance fraud case! This user got AI to help analyze nearly 500 legal documents and draft motions, which totally swayed the court to reopen hearings. Talk about a game-changer! This epic case spotlights AI's insane potential for legal audits and tackling real-world problems. It's also got everyone buzzing about AI hallucination and how AI might shake things up in healthcare, education, and beyond.

### AI Frontier Research
1.  A new study from METR, a non-profit AI research organization, just dropped a bombshell: their randomized controlled trial unexpectedly found that AI programming tools *decreased* experienced developers' productivity by 19%! This totally goes against the 20% boost developers usually expect and has set social media ablaze. The takeaway? If you wanna know AI's real impact on productivity, you gotta look at actual real-world data, not just what folks *think* is happening.

2.  Meta and NYU just dropped a groundbreaking study, unveiling a new way to achieve 'selective forgetting' in large models by precisely tweaking Transformer attention heads. This wild 'AI amnesia technique,' powered by SAMD and SAMI tech, lets you fine-tune an AI's knowledge storage like a mixing console! We're talking about deleting specific concepts (like 'dogs bark,' who knew?), boosting mathematical reasoning, messing with security modules, and even influencing visual model recognition. This is a game-changer, folks, kicking off the 'editable era' for large models and forcing us to rethink AI interpretability and safety boundaries.['Paper Link'](https://www.arxiv.org/pdf/2506.17052)

### Open-Source TOP Projects

4.  uBlock is a super-efficient ad blocker for Chromium and Firefox, totally famous for being fast, lightweight, and boasting a whopping 55,554 stars! Get it here: ['Project Link'](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock).

### Social Media Shares
1.  AI 'time travel' photo generation is blowing up on social media lately, letting users upload their childhood pics to ChatGPT or Douyin to see what they might look like all grown up! While these AI predictions are super fun, let's be real, they're not always spot-on. You might get some 'AI hallucinations' or results that just don't quite hit the mark. But hey, it's still a wildly popular entertainment app, and everyone's jumping on the bandwagon!['More Details'](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzIzNjc1NzUzMw==&mid=2247809745&idx=3&sn=b455da483fad293e9d2d03420bd824ee)

2.  Yang Yi's noticed something pretty cool: developers are already building MultiAgent systems using Claudecode! This setup is super slick, handling contextual conversations via Markdown files, creating a neat MVP for multi-agent parallel processing right there in VSCode. He's totally stoked about this method and reckons that with those '24/7 engineers' diving in, this tech will mature wicked fast. The only thing left to figure out, he says, is the nitty-gritty of cross-terminal hooks.

3.  orange.ai points out a big win: Claude Code plays nice with the Kimi K2 model! This totally proves that Claude's Agent architecture is super versatile and can hook up with *any* large model out there, even Gemini and Grok. It's a huge shout-out to user choice – we, the users, get to pick our models, not just the big model companies.

4.  Guizang (guizang.ai) is totally stoked, announcing they're using Kimi K2 to whip up a complete component library! They've already successfully generated some insanely smooth interactive product onboarding prompt components for backend products, which is a night-and-day difference from the painful dev experiences of the past. Guizang also showed off Kimi K2's knack for spitting out awesome frontend components with just a few simple prompts. Talk about a game-changer!

5.  Sam from OpenAI has reportedly pushed back the release of their upcoming open-source model. According to K2 (Yuchen Jin), it wasn't Kimi that caused the delay. Apparently, this model is super powerful despite having parameters way less than 1T, but they found some 'ridiculous' or 'low-level' bug right before launch. What a bummer!['More Details'](https://x.com/op7418/status/1944254013408784624)

6.  Yangyi showed off a mind-blowing demo: a 100% code project cooked up entirely by AI (Claude) in just six hours! This highlights AI's seriously strong processing power, especially in non-super-specialized fields. He pointed out that once AI ramps up productivity big time, the battle for traffic is gonna get even fiercer. So, the takeaway? Get those human-AI collaborative automated systems out there ASAP to grab market share and build some killer leveraged assets!['More Details'](https://x.com/Yangyixxxx/status/1944252584950374435)
