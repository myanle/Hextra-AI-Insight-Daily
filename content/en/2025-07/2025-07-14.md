### AI Product & Feature Updates
1. Grok 4, xAI's powerful large language model, just dropped for its two-year anniversary, totally blowing Silicon Valley's mind with its insane animation generation, game deployment, and 3D black hole simulation capabilities! This beast got a hundredfold boost in computing power thanks to training on 200,000 GPUs. And get this: Elon Musk's SpaceX is dumping a whopping $2 billion into xAI, aiming to develop it into a "Cosmic Brain," even predicting Grok might eventually make it to Mars. üöÄüëæ

2. ChatGPT just helped a Reddit user successfully blow the lid off a massive decade-long, $5 million inheritance fraud case! This user leveraged AI to analyze nearly 500 legal documents and draft motions, getting the court to reopen hearings. This insane case totally spotlights AI's huge potential in legal auditing and real-world problem-solving, though it also sparks a lot of chatter and reflection on AI hallucination and its broader applications in areas like AI healthcare and AI education. ü§Ø‚öñÔ∏è

### AI Frontier Research
1. METR, a non-profit AI research organization, just dropped some wild random controlled experiment results: AI programming tools actually made experienced developers *less* productive by 19%! That's totally opposite to the 20% speedup devs usually expect, and it's stirred up a massive debate on social media. This study totally highlights that we need real-world experimental data, not just self-reported stuff, to gauge AI's impact on productivity. ü§Øüìâ

2. Meta and New York University's latest research is straight-up groundbreaking, revealing a killer method to achieve "selective forgetting" in large models by precisely manipulating Transformer attention heads. This "AI Amnesia" technique, using SAMD and SAMI tech, lets us fine-tune AI's knowledge storage like a total pro, not just deleting specific concepts (like "dogs bark") but also boosting mathematical reasoning, tweaking safety modules, and even influencing visual model recognition. This opens up a wild "editable era" for large models and sparks fresh thinking on AI interpretability and safety boundaries. üß†‚ú®

### Social Media Buzz
1. This new **AI "time-travel" photo generation** trend has been blowing up on social media lately! People are using **ChatGPT** or **Douyin effects** to upload their childhood photos and get a glimpse of what they'll look like grown up. ü§≥üîÆ While these AI predictions are super fun, they're not always spot-on (think "AI hallucinations" or just not what you expected). But hey, it's a wildly popular entertainment app and everyone's jumping in! Get the full scoop: ['More Details'](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzIzNjc1NzUzMw==&mid=2247809745&idx=3&sn=b455da483fad293e9d2d03420bd824ee)

3. Heads up from orange.ai: **Claude Code** plays nice with the **Kimi K2** model! üåêü§ù This totally proves that Claude's Agent architecture is universal and can work with *any* large model out there, including Gemini and Grok. It's all about emphasizing that users, not the big model companies, get to call the shots on model choice.

4. Guizang (guizang.ai) is stoked to share they're using **Kimi K2** to whip up a complete component library! ü•≥üéâ They even successfully generated incredibly smooth interactive product guiding components needed for a backend product‚Äîa total game-changer compared to the past pain of developing these. He also showcased Kimi K2's ability to create awesome frontend components with just simple prompts.

5. Sam (OpenAI) just pushed back an upcoming **open-source model** release üòÆ‚Äçüí®ü§´. According to K2 (Yuchen Jin), it's not because of Kimi, but because this powerful model, despite its parameters being way less than 1T, hit a "ridiculous" or "rookie" error right before launch. What a bummer! Catch the full story: ['More Details'](https://x.com/op7418/status/1944254013408784624)

6. Yangyi just blew minds by showcasing a **100% code project** fully generated by **AI** (Claude) in a mere six hours! ü§ñüìà This seriously highlights AI's powerful capabilities in non-cutting-edge fields. He also points out that once AI massively boosts productivity, the competition for **traffic** will go through the roof. So, it's high time human-AI collaborative automation systems jump in to grab market share and create some seriously leveraged assets.
