2. **Li Jigang**, the big boss, recently dropped a super fascinating **horror novel** creation **prompt** – it's literally the holy grail for AI novel writing! 📖 He doesn't push the AI to spook people directly; instead, he guides it to subtly infuse a creeping sense of unease, that 'chilling upon reflection' feeling! 😱 This prompt emphasizes creating a deep sense of **fear** by blurring details, making everyday things creepy, and dropping incomplete truths. It's all about one thing: restraint, but profound impact! Truly a high-level play! ✨

7. Baoyu shared an article by Jack Morris that's seriously a wake-up call for the AI field! 🔔 The article drops a bombshell: The four major breakthroughs in **Large Language Models (LLMs)** weren't actually because of some groundbreaking new theory. Nope! Each time, it was all about successfully leveraging new **data sources** they dug up! 🤯 Think **ImageNet**, vast amounts of internet text, and human feedback, to name a few. The article hammers home this point: **Data** is the true unsung hero pushing AI forward! 🦸‍♀️ It even predicts that future AI development will keep relying on new **data** discoveries, like **YouTube videos** or **embodied data** collected by robots, rather than just model or algorithm innovations. Looks like whoever masters data, masters the world! 👑
