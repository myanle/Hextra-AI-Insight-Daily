7.  Baoyu shared an article by Jack Morris that's a real "wake-up call" for the AI field! The article points out that the four major breakthroughs in **Large Language Models (LLMs)** weren't due to new theories, but each time succeeded by discovering and leveraging new **data sources**! For example, **ImageNet**, massive internet text, and human feedback. The article emphasizes that **data** is the "unsung hero" driving continuous AI progress! It even predicts that future AI development will continue to rely on new **data** discoveries, such as **YouTube videos** or robot-collected **embodied data**, rather than innovations in models or algorithms. It seems that "whoever has data rules the world"! 📊🌐👑
