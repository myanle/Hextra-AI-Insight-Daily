2.  **4KAgent** is truly a magical "magician"! It's a unified **agent-based super-resolution general system** whose goal is to universally enhance any image to **4K** or even higher resolution. This system, through the collaborative work of its three core components—**Profiling**, **Perception Agent**, and **Restoration Agent**—can instantly transform severely degraded low-resolution inputs into crisp, realistic 4K blockbusters! It has achieved **state-of-the-art** performance in 26 benchmarks across 11 task categories; it's practically a top master in the image enhancement field! To learn more, please visit [Paper Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07105).
3.  This latest research is no small feat. It aims to drive a major breakthrough in **text-to-motion generation** by constructing the largest **MotionMillion** dataset to date (containing over 2 million high-quality motion sequences) and a comprehensive **MotionMillion-Eval** benchmark, striving for **zero-shot generalization**! By scaling the model to **7B parameters**, this method demonstrates strong **zero-shot generalization** capabilities across various domains and complex composite motions. To learn more exciting details, please visit [Paper Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07095).
