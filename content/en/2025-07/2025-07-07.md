### **AI Product & Feature Updates**
1. On June 30th, Baidu made a "massive move" by officially **open-sourcing its Wenchxin Large Model 4.5 series**! They released 10 models and a full suite of training and deployment toolchains in one go. This update is a "capability explosion," especially for **multimodal understanding**, handling videos like a pro! 🎥 Even better, thanks to the **heterogeneous Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)** architecture and various optimization techniques, the deployment barrier has been significantly lowered—even beginners can jump in! 🚀 The goal of this open-sourcing effort is to streamline the entire process "from model download to application launch," utilizing "powerful tools" like ERNIEKit and FastDeploy to skyrocket development and deployment efficiency, fostering a thriving AI application ecosystem. ✨

### **AI Frontier Research**
1. Causal-Copilot, an **autonomous causal analysis agent** from the Biwei Huang Lab at UC San Diego, has been released—and it's an absolute "smart wizard" in the **causal analysis** field! 🧙 Its strength lies in integrating over 20 advanced **causal analysis algorithms**, specifically tackling high-barrier challenges like **causal discovery** and **causal inference**. Get this: it even outperformed **GPT-4o** in tests! 🤯 This system can **automate** method selection and parameter tuning, plus it offers **open-source code** and an **online experience** platform. Its mission? To accelerate scientific discovery, helping researchers better understand causal mechanisms between things, making scientific research a whole lot easier! 🔬

2. Meta's research team has dropped another "black tech" bombshell! 🤯 They've proposed a "see clearly even when spinning" **rotation-invariant trilinear attention mechanism** (also known as **2-simplicial Transformer**) 🔄. This trick aims to optimize the **Scaling Law** for **large language models**, like capturing the "essence" of natural language precisely within a "compressed file" 📦 using a **limited token budget**! It's a godsend for solving the **pre-training scaling bottleneck** caused by the scarcity of high-quality **tokens**, and it's especially poised to make **large-scale models**' efficiency shoot through the roof! 🚀
