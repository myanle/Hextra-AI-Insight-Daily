### **AI Product & Feature Updates**
1. Baidu made a "big move" on June 30th: officially **open-sourcing the Wenxin (ERNIE) 4.5 large model series** 脂, dropping 10 models and their accompanying training and deployment toolchains all at once! This wave of updates is nothing short of a "power explosion" 窶・especially when it comes to **multimodal understanding**, it's seriously "rock-solid" when handling video 道笨ｨ. What's even cooler is that thanks to the **Heterogeneous Mixture of Experts (MoE)** architecture and various optimization techniques, the deployment barrier has been significantly lowered, so even "newbies" can get their hands on it now! The goal of this open-sourcing effort is to streamline the entire process "from model download to application launch," using "powerful tools" like ERNIEKit and FastDeploy 噫 to make development and deployment efficiency skyrocket, allowing AI applications to "blossom everywhere," and fostering a more vibrant ecosystem! 註

2. The **Meta** research team has come out with some "black tech" again! They've proposed a **rotationally invariant trilinear attention mechanism** (also known as a **2-simplicial Transformer**) that can "see clearly even when circling around" 売. This trick aims to optimize the **Scaling Law** for **large language models**, like being able to precisely grasp the "essence" of natural language within a "compressed package" 逃, even with a **limited token budget**! This is practically a godsend for tackling the **pre-training scaling bottleneck** caused by the scarcity of high-quality **tokens**, especially as it can make the efficiency of **large-scale models** "shoot right up" 嶋.
