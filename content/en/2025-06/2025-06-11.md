3.  The well-known thinker Li Jigang pointed out incisively that when AI technology becomes more and more **efficient and powerful**, human **judgment**, **taste**, and **understanding of the purpose** of things will become more **hardcore**. Because although AI can generate thousands of solutions and execute them perfectly, it cannot replace humans in making **choices**, defining **beauty**, or understanding complex and profound **human nature**. This reminds us that in the AI era, what is truly valuable may be the "human-only skills" that AI cannot reach.
