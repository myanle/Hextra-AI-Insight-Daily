4.  💡 wwwgoubuli highlighted Corey Chiu's **Vibe Coding best practices**, emphasizing that the core idea is to **optimize development steps**, rather than getting hung up on choosing specific models. 🤔 This approach is super insightful for both human and **AI** collaboration, brilliantly combining **Cursor** and **Claude Code** to build a **complete workflow** that's **efficient and smooth** from idea to code implementation 👍.

5.  ✍️ Mu Yao posted, gushing about **Gemini 2.5 Pro**'s writing style. He reckons its expressions are "profound, appropriate, vivid, rich, and fresh," totally outshining DeepSeek's "greasy vibe" and GPT-4.5's blandness. 😮 He even feels Gemini 2.5 Pro's writing is on par with his own best work, making him "despair" at how powerful AI has become 😂!

6.  🏆 NVIDIA AI Developer just announced the three winning projects from their Agent Toolkit Hackathon: **cuOptIQ** is all about optimizing factory forklift paths, **OpenCodeReview** automates code security analysis and vulnerability detection, and **Holistic Travel Assistant** totally revolutionizes travel planning 🗺️! These projects really show off the massive potential of connecting **AI agents** using the NVIDIA Agent Intelligence toolkit.

7.  ⚠️ wwwgoubuli brought up a really important point: it's a bad idea to try and handle all rules with massive, long-text prompts, because that often leads to missed instructions. 🤔 He believes a better strategy is to **layer things**, use **multi-agent processing**, and let each agent stick to its own job, instead of blindly mimicking how some models (like Claude) just shove all the instructions in at once. Now *that's* some real wisdom! More deets: ['https://x.com/wwwgoubuli/status/1938647120812356008'](https://x.com/wwwgoubuli/status/1938647120812356008)
