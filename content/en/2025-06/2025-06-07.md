It's already free for users! This could totally spark some fresh innovation for **AI** in the **blockchain** and **decentralized application** (dApp) spaces.
4.  Get ready, China! üé• **Paiwo AI**, the local version of the super-popular overseas **AI video generation platform PixVerse**, has officially dropped! It's now live with both a mobile app and web version, aiming to give local content creators and businesses a seriously efficient and easy-to-use **AI video generation tool**. <br/> [![Image](https://cdn.jsdmirror.com/gh/justlovemaki/imagehub@main/images/2025/07/news_01k024y3tcf09s854ks0323534.avif)](https://cdn.jsdmirror.com/gh/justlovemaki/imagehub@main/images/2025/07/news_01k024y3tcf09s854ks0323534.avif) <br/> What's cool is "**Paiwo AI**" lets you generate high-quality, multi-style videos with just one click from text or images. It's powered by the PixVerse V4.5 algorithm, but with some sweet localized tweaks, which should really push the widespread adoption of **AI video technology** in the Chinese market.
5.  On June 5, 2025, **ElevenLabs** dropped a bombshell: their new **Text-to-Speech (TTS) model**, **Eleven v3 (Alpha)**, is being hailed as the "most powerful on Earth." üé§ This isn't just about turning text into silky-smooth voice; it lets you fine-tune emotions, speed, and even sprinkle in sound effects using **audio tags**, making "performance synthesis" a reality. <br/> [![Image](https://cdn.jsdmirror.com/gh/justlovemaki/imagehub@main/images/2025/07/news_01k024y7epf2v9w78szt0c4fa0.avif)](https://cdn.jsdmirror.com/gh/justlovemaki/imagehub@main/images/2025/07/news_01k024y7epf2v9w78szt0c4fa0.avif) <br/> [![Image](https://cdn.jsdmirror.com/gh/justlovemaki/imagehub@main/images/2025/07/news_01k024ybs3fjrvewa63q074tra.avif)](https://cdn.jsdmirror.com/gh/justlovemaki/imagehub@main/images/2025/07/news_01k024ybs3fjrvewa63q074tra.avif) <br/> Plus, it speaks **over 70 languages** and nails **multi-character natural conversations**, with automatic tagging making creation a breeze. This game-changer is set to take over everything from **film and TV dubbing** to **virtual assistants**, totally reshaping the future of **AI voice**.

### **Cutting-Edge AI Research**

1.  This research paper dives into a slick new method called **Dynamic Memory Sparsification (DMS)**. üß† What it does is super cool: it compresses the **KV cache** of **Transformer LLMs** during inference, letting these models **super-scale** to pump out more tokens and crank up accuracy, all while using the same old computational muscle. The best part? This method hits high compression rates with just a handful of training steps and seriously beefs up the accuracy of various **LLMs** (like **Qwen-R1 32B**) on tough benchmarks like **AIME 24**, **GPQA**, and **LiveCodeBench**. Check out the paper here: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05345](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05345).

### **AI Industry Outlook & Social Impact**

1.  **Wang Xingxing**, the **CEO of Unitree Robotics**, dropped some insights at the 7th **Beijing Academy of Artificial Intelligence (BAAI) Conference**. ü§ñ He emphasized that Unitree's ultimate mission has always been about getting **robots** to do some real, **practical work** in homes and industrial zones.

Looks like they're ready to fast-track practical robot deployment!
2.  Famous tech blogger **Wang Ziruo** just announced his big comeback to content creation on **Bilibili**, officially rebranding as "**Wang Ziruo AI**"! üé¨ He's kicking off a second entrepreneurial adventure as an **AI review UP Master**, pouring his energy into **AI content creation** and **AI applications** to help traditional industries jump on the digital transformation train. <br/> [![Image](https://cdn.jsdmirror.com/gh/justlovemaki/imagehub@main/images/2025/07/news_01k024yhz8fy1b7w4tz8vkqec1.avif)](https://cdn.jsdmirror.com/gh/justlovemaki/imagehub@main/images/2025/07/news_01k024yhz8fy1b7w4tz8vkqec1.avif) <br/> In his video, he gave a shout-out to **Dong Mingzhu** and **Lei Jun** for their encouragement and support, also mentioning that his previous gig at Gree was all about revamping their sales system.

2.  **Yangyi** dropped some serious wisdom, sharing a cool formula for product value in the **AI era**! üí° He points out that a product's value hinges on the gap between "**New Experience**" (think awesome results and sleek design) and "**Migration Cost**" (that old platform data sunk cost plus the hassle of learning something new). So, if you wanna build a high-value **AI product**, you gotta deliver results that blow minds, rock a gorgeous interface, and make sure it's super easy for users to switch their data over and jump right in.
