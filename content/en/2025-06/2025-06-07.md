#### **AI Cutting-Edge Research**

1.  This research paper introduces a new method called **Dynamic Memory Sparsification (DMS)**, which achieves **ultra-expansion** during inference by compressing the **KV cache** of **Transformer LLMs**, thus generating more tokens and improving model accuracy with the same computing resources. The method requires only a few training steps to achieve high compression rates and significantly improves the accuracy of various **LLMs** such as **Qwen-R1 32B** on benchmarks like **AIME 24**, **GPQA**, and **LiveCodeBench**. Paper address: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05345](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05345).

#### **AI Industry Outlook and Social Impact**

1.  **Yu Shu Technology CEO Wang Xingxing** stated at the 7th **Beijing Zhiyuan Conference** that the company's ultimate goal has always been to make **robots** achieve **practical work** in household and industrial settings, and embodied intelligence demonstrations such as dancing and fighting are merely means of training and technology verification. <br/> [![Image](https://autoproxy.justlikemaki.vip/?pp=https://pic.chinaz.com/picmap/202304171730201359_10.jpg)](https://autoproxy.justlikemaki.vip/?pp=https://pic.chinaz.com/picmap/202304171730201359_10.jpg) <br/> He revealed that in the first half of this year, the **humanoid robot** has initially taken shape in the commercial leasing market and brought considerable value, and the practical application of robots will be accelerated in the future.

2.  **Yangyi** shared the product value formula in the **AI era**, pointing out that product value depends on the difference between "**new experience**" (obtaining effective results and aesthetics) and "**migration costs**" (sunk costs of data on the old platform and the threshold for getting started). Therefore, building high-value **AI products** requires providing unexpectedly effective results, a sufficiently beautiful interface, and striving to reduce the difficulty of user data migration and the barrier to entry of the product.
