#### **Social Media Buzz**

1.  In a social media share, user **meng shao** dropped an awesome comparison test🎥🍝🏎️ of three **AI video products**: **Midjourney**, **Veo3**, and **Hailuo**! She used the exact same prompt to check out how differently they perform when generating videos of "spaghetti racing a car." Talk about a visual feast! You guys can watch the videos provided to get a direct feel for how each model performs.

2.  Xiangyang Qiaomu is totally blown away🤯🌌🏗️ by the physics effects of the **Hailuo 02 model**, saying it brings to life a "living," interactive **virtual world** with **physics understanding** far beyond Veo 3. This model has evolved from "individual realism" to "**interactive realism**" with its environment, showcasing stunning results and stronger model capabilities through test cases like collapsing blocks. It's truly mind-boggling!

3.  Baoyu made a profound point🤔🧠💡: in the **AI era**, **depth** of technical skill is way more important than **breadth**, because AI can fill in gaps in breadth but can't make up for a lack of depth. He emphasized that **experts in their field**, even with AI's help, can still crank out high-quality results; but those who are jacks-of-all-trades and masters of none will struggle to hit excellent levels. This really highlights the true nature of AI: **empowering professional skills** rather than **completely replacing them**. Something to chew on!

4.  Baoyu also brought up a hot debate💻💸🧐 about **AI code generation quality**, noting that in the context of large projects, the code produced by **Claude Code** isn't as good as that from the more expensive **Cline + Gemini 2.5 Pro**, and the former needs more human intervention. This doesn't just show the big differences in code generation capabilities across various **AI models**, but it also reveals the **steep costs** that can come with pursuing **high-quality AI-assisted programming**. It's truly a love-hate balancing act!
