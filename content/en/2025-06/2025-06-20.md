#### **AI Frontier Research**
1. The **OneRec** proposed by the Kuaishou technical team is the first to reconstruct the entire chain of the **recommendation system** through an end-to-end generative architecture, which significantly improved the recommendation effect and greatly reduced operating costs, enabling the effective application of **reinforcement learning** technology in recommendation scenarios. The system has served approximately 25% of the requests in the Kuaishou App, successfully verified the **Scaling Law** of the recommendation system, and provided the first industrial-grade feasible solution for moving from the traditional **Pipeline** to an end-to-end generative architecture.
