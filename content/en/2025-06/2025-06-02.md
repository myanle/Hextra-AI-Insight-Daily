#### **AI Cutting-Edge Research**

1.  Huawei recently demonstrated a stunning breakthrough through its "Ascend + Pangu Ultra MoE" system: a MoE large model with nearly one trillion parameters can solve an advanced math problem in just 2 seconds without using a GPU. This not only demonstrates Huawei's strong capabilities in independent and controllable domestic computing power and model training, but also opens up new possibilities for the training and application of large-scale AI models in the future.

2.  This paper reveals the significant difficulties that current **Vision-Language Models** (**VLMs**) encounter in understanding and solving English palindrome puzzle by constructing a benchmark. Although VLMs demonstrate some ability in decoding simple visual clues, they still fall short when it comes to tasks that require **abstract reasoning**, **lateral thinking**, and understanding **visual metaphors**, indicating that multimodal abstraction is a unique challenge they face. Details: [Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23759).
3.  **LoRAShop** is an innovative **multi-concept image editing framework** that leverages the characteristics of **Rectified Flow Transformers** to seamlessly integrate multiple themes or styles into the original scene without retraining the model. This technology, through the intelligent fusion of LoRA weights, not only preserves the overall background and details of the image, but also surpasses existing baselines in identity retention, bringing a revolutionary "Photoshop-like" experience to personalized **image generation** and **editing**. Details: [Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23758).
4.  **DeepTheorem** is an informal **theorem proving framework** that utilizes **natural language** and **reinforcement learning** (**RL-Zero**) to enhance the mathematical reasoning capabilities of **large language models** (**LLMs**). Through a large-scale, high-quality dataset and innovative strategies, this framework significantly improves the performance of LLMs in IMO-level informal theorem proving, demonstrating its great potential in mathematical exploration and automated proof fields. Details: [Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23754).

#### **AI Industry Outlook and Social Impact**

1.  According to an analysis by Alex de Vries-Gao, a PhD student at the Institute for Environmental Studies at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, the electricity consumption of artificial intelligence is expected to approach half of the total electricity consumption of global data centers by the end of 2025, meaning its energy consumption will soon surpass Bitcoin mining. Despite improvements in technological efficiency, the electricity demand of AI is still growing rapidly, highlighting the importance of finding a balance between energy consumption and sustainable development.

2.  Recently, hackers successfully carried out a supply chain attack by disguising malicious packages as the **Aliyun AI SDK**, using **malicious code** hidden in **Pickle** format ML models to steal sensitive user information. This reveals new challenges facing the **AI security supply chain**, the inadequacy of traditional security tools in detecting malicious ML models, and the potential risks faced by developers.
