They've slashed the cost of using it, which is gonna seriously speed up the adoption of **AI Agents** in industries like consumer electronics, automotive, and finance. Thanks to their **innovative pricing strategy**, daily calls have skyrocketed from 12.7 trillion **tokens** in March to a whopping 16.4 trillion **tokens** by the end of May. This is paving the way for companies to build truly smart AI Agents. <br/> [![图片](https://autoproxy.justlikemaki.vip/?pp=https://pic.chinaz.com/picmap/202405160815252726_0.jpg)](https://autoproxy.justlikemaki.vip/?pp=https://pic.chinaz.com/picmap/202405160815252726_0.jpg) <br/>
2.  Xiaomi just announced they're holding a product launch event in **late July**, where they'll be showing off their **first true AI glasses**. These glasses are going head-to-head with **Meta Ray-Ban**, and they're packing some heat with a **dual-core architecture**, **HD lenses**, and **powerful AI features**. Expect them to perceive the real world and offer a super rich experience with tons of interactive apps. This isn't just a big step for Xiaomi in the **smart wearable space**; it's a sign that **AI tech** is gonna be playing an even bigger role in our daily lives moving forward. <br/> [![图片](https://autoproxy.justlikemaki.vip/?pp=https://pic.chinaz.com/picmap/202201041728161005_6.jpg)](https://autoproxy.justlikemaki.vip/?pp=https://pic.chinaz.com/picmap/202201041728161005_6.jpg) <br/>
3.  AI startup **Genspark** just dropped the **Genspark AI Browser**, which is basically a smart browser loaded with advanced **AI tech**.

4.  To combat the growing problem of spotting fake **AIGC** (AI-generated content), researchers have come up with something totally new: **IVY-FAKE**, an **explainable detection framework** for images and videos. It doesn't just ID AI-generated stuff; it actually "explains" *why* it made that call, solving the "black box" problem that's been plaguing traditional detection tools. This framework cleverly uses massive multi-modal datasets and the **IVY-XDETECTOR model** to pinpoint visual artifacts in images or videos, seriously boosting the transparency and trustworthiness of AI content detection. It's a whole new, powerful solution for fighting fake news and tracing content back to its source. <br/> [![图片](https://autoproxy.justlikemaki.vip/?pp=https://pic.chinaz.com/picmap/202405161743174033_10.jpg)](https://autoproxy.justlikemaki.vip/?pp=https://pic.chinaz.com/picmap/202405161743174033_10.jpg) <br/>
