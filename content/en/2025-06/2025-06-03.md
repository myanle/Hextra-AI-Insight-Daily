#### **AI Product and Feature Updates**
1.  Google recently rolled out the **Gemini Live** feature in the US, officially launching on **iOS** and **iPadOS** platforms. Users can now experience the convenience of **AI**-powered scene and screen content recognition for free through the **Gemini App**. This innovation not only enhances the user experience but also signals that **AI** technology is further integrating into daily life, becoming a go-to smart assistant for everyone. <br/> [![Image](https://autoproxy.justlikemaki.vip/?pp=https://pic.chinaz.com/2025/0603/6388453725280965957304782.png)](https://autoproxy.justlikemaki.vip/?pp=https://pic.chinaz.com/2025/0603/6388453725280965957304782.png) <br/>
2.  Microsoft has just launched the free **Bing Video Creator** tool, based on **OpenAI Sora** tech, making it a breeze for users to create short videos using simple text prompts. This tool is now live within the Bing mobile app globally, drastically lowering the barrier to entry for video creation and promising to spice up the user's creative experience. <br/> [![Image](https://autoproxy.justlikemaki.vip/?pp=https://pic.chinaz.com/2025/0603/6388453719041406883771175.png)](https://autoproxy.justlikemaki.vip/?pp=https://pic.chinaz.com/2025/0603/6388453719041406883771175.png) <br/>
3.  The National University of Singapore (NUS) team recently released the **OmniConsistency** project, replicating **GPT-4o's** consistency in image stylization at an ultra-low cost, solving a major headache in the open-source community. Through a unique learning framework and modular architecture, this project has the potential to become a key tool in the image generation space, driving forward **AI** art creation. <br/> [![Image](https://autoproxy.justlikemaki.vip/?pp=https://pic.chinaz.com/2025/0603/6388453880310640421505355.png)](https://autoproxy.justlikemaki.vip/?pp=https://pic.chinaz.com/2025/0603/6388453880310640421505355.png) <br/>

#### **AI Cutting-Edge Research**
1.  **WebChoreArena** ([Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01952)) introduces a brand new benchmark containing 532 meticulously curated tasks, designed to evaluate the ability of **LLM**-driven web browsing agents to handle tedious and complex web tasks. Research has found that, although advanced large models such as **GPT-4o** show significant progress on this benchmark, there is still huge room for improvement compared to general web tasks, highlighting the challenges of dealing with complex **"web chores."**
2.  **RoboMaster** ([Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01943)) proposes an innovative video generation framework for robotic manipulation, effectively solving the problem of reduced visual fidelity in multi-objective interactions through collaborative trajectory modeling and phased decomposition of interaction processes. This tech has successfully achieved a new breakthrough in the quality of video generation in **robotic manipulation**, providing more accurate solutions for **trajectory control** in complex scenarios.

#### **AI Industry Outlook and Social Impact**
1.  Recently, Utah attorney Richard Bednar was fined by the court for citing fake cases generated by **ChatGPT** in court documents, once again sparking widespread controversy over the application of **AI** in the legal field. This incident serves as a stark reminder to legal professionals to maintain a rigorous **review responsibility** when using emerging technologies to ensure the accuracy of legal documents. <br/> [![Image](https://autoproxy.justlikemaki.vip/?pp=https://pic.chinaz.com/picmap/202304121052180076_0.jpg)](https://autoproxy.justlikemaki.vip/?pp=https://pic.chinaz.com/picmap/202304121052180076_0.jpg) <br/>
2.  **OpenAI** plans to transform **ChatGPT** into a **T-shaped skilled** "**super assistant**" in the first half of 2025, aiming to challenge Apple **Siri's** market position. This strategic document reveals that **OpenAI** not only wants **ChatGPT** to become a smart companion capable of handling everyday chores and complex tasks, but also calls for users to be able to freely choose their default **AI** assistant on all platforms, driving the **AI** market to be more open.
