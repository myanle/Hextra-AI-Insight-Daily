#### **AI Frontier Research**
1. **MMSearch-R1** 🔬🔍 is a groundbreaking **end-to-end reinforcement learning framework** that lets **Large Multimodal Models (LMMs)** 🧠 perform multi-round searches in real-world internet environments, on demand. It cleverly integrates image and text search tools to solve problems super efficiently! This model really shines in **knowledge-intensive** and **information-seeking VQA tasks**. Not only does it outperform similarly sized **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** baseline models, but it can even match the performance of larger RAG models while using over 30% fewer search calls. How cool is that?! ✨ ['Paper Link'](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20670)

#### **AI Industry Outlook & Social Impact**
1. **AI security company** **XBOW** 🛡️💥 just made history! With their self-developed AI tool, "**XBOW**," they've beaten human researchers for the first time, snagging the #1 spot on the US leaderboard of **HackerOne**, a globally renowned **vulnerability crowdsourcing platform**! This is a massive breakthrough for AI in the **vulnerability detection** space! 👏 This **fully automated penetration testing system** has already submitted nearly 1060 vulnerabilities on HackerOne and successfully raked in $75 million in Series B funding 💰. This totally signals that AI is about to completely reshape the **cybersecurity** landscape, speeding up vulnerability discovery and fixes.

2. Recently, ByteDance's Seed team put five mainstream **large models**, including **Doubao Seed 1.6-Thinking** and **Gemini 2.5 Pro**, to the test 🎓✨. They crushed it in the 2025 **Shandong Gaokao** (National College Entrance Exam) full-subject closed-book assessment. Doubao snagged first place for liberal arts (683 points), while Gemini took the crown for science (655 points). Overall, their scores are good enough to aim for top-tier universities like Tsinghua and Peking University, and at least guarantee a spot in a 985-level university! In just one year, the large models' Gaokao scores jumped by over a hundred points, showcasing their powerful **textual understanding**, **multimodal comprehension**, and **reasoning abilities**! 🚀 This shows that the Gaokao is no longer a challenge for testing their 'intelligence.' Moving forward, they should dive deeper into areas like **scientific research** and **artistic creation**. The sky's the limit! 🎨 ['More Details'](https://www.jiqizhixin.com/articles/2025-06-26-12)

4. Blogger Xiao Hu reported that **Microsoft** ⚔️ hinted they're ditching talks with **OpenAI** about OpenAI becoming a for-profit company and going public. The reason behind it? Both sides couldn't agree on the terms 🤔. **OpenAI** wanted to end Microsoft's current rights to model **intellectual property** and their 20% **revenue share**, but Microsoft wasn't on board with their new offer. There are even whispers that this might lead **OpenAI** to pull the "nuclear option"💥 of accusing them of **anti-competitive behavior**.

5. Meng Shao shared Andrej Karpathy's insightful take, pointing out that when it comes to AI applications, we should totally be focusing on "**context engineering**" 🧠💡 rather than just plain "**prompt engineering**." That's because "context engineering" involves carefully designing **information windows**, optimizing **information density**, and **content structure** – way more complex than just typing in a few prompts! ✨ Plus, Karpathy debunked the misconception that AI applications are just "ChatGPT wrappers." He stressed that actual development covers a whole bunch of complex steps like problem decomposition, model selection, UI management, and security protection. Seriously, it's no joke! 💪 ['More Details'](https://x.com/shao__meng/status/1938120617494253712)
6. Blogger wwwgoubuli predicts that AI is ushering in an era of "**fact-generating lightweight applications**" 🔮🚀. Soon, users will truly be able to "speak it into existence," instantly creating and destroying all sorts of apps. Meanwhile, the marketing and promotion value of traditional large software will drop significantly. He believes this is all thanks to the widespread adoption of **high-speed inference technology** and breakthrough experiences from models like **Google Gemini**. He predicts that in the future, AI will become **infrastructure** like water, electricity, and gas, but many applications themselves will become invisible and valueless. It might even lead to a monopoly on the "**gateway to a magical world**" 🌌. ['More Details'](https://x.com/wwwgoubuli/status/1938082798973096160)
