### **AI Product & Feature Updates**
1.  **Manus AI** has just dropped its new **Chat Mode** for free, making AI tools super accessible. It can seamlessly switch between instant Q&A and **Agent Mode**, possibly powered by **Google Gemini** ‚Äì a total game-changer for productivity! üöÄ <br/> ![Image](https://cdn.jsdmirror.com/gh/justlovemaki/imagehub@main/images/2025/07/news_01k024kay4ftpber24mbr3s33r.avif) <br/>
2.  **Google** has hooked up its latest **image generation model**, **Imagen4**, into the **Gemini** platform for free! This seriously amps up **AI image creation**, crushing it in image detail, **text rendering**, and **color performance** to give you a pro-level experience. This move isn't just about streamlining creativity; it totally shows off Google's deep play in the **AI** field, hinting that **Imagen4** is set to go global. üé® <br/> ![Image](https://cdn.jsdmirror.com/gh/justlovemaki/imagehub@main/images/2025/07/news_01k024kf2me2wtb9kb17t4mvt1.avif) <br/>
3.  **Google DeepMind** just dropped a groundbreaking **AI** system and its "**Weather Lab**" platform, which can predict **tropical cyclone** paths and intensity up to **15 days** in advance with unprecedented accuracy! This thing effectively solves traditional weather model headaches. It's faster and more precise than current methods, and after teaming up with the **National Hurricane Center (NHC)**, its experimental **AI forecasts** will be integrated into NHC's operations. This could totally save lives and cut economic losses in future hurricane seasons, marking a massive leap for **AI** in weather forecasting. üå™Ô∏è <br/> ![Image](https://cdn.jsdmirror.com/gh/justlovemaki/imagehub@main/images/2025/07/news_01k024khccemvvme0n4m47akst.avif) <br/>

### **Cutting-Edge AI Research**
1.  **Cursor**, that awesome **AI programming tool**, is on a mission to totally rethink coding using **AI**. Its goal isn't just to help you code, but to enable "**intent-driven" software development**, freeing engineers from boring code to focus on higher-level "**taste**" and design. `Cursor` builds its core advantage with a standalone editor and data flywheel, aiming to lead the future of **AI coding** and already has wide recognition from many top companies. üöÄ <br/> ![Image](https://cdn.jsdmirror.com/gh/justlovemaki/imagehub@main/images/2025/07/news_01k024kme4fzh84d63ybzc90ff.avif) <br/>
2.  **AutoMind** is an adaptive **knowledge-driven Large Language Model (LLM) agent framework**, built to tackle the rigidity and lack of empirical knowledge in existing data science LLM agents when handling complex tasks. By integrating an **expert knowledge base**, an **agent knowledge-driven tree search algorithm**, and **adaptive coding strategies**, `AutoMind` absolutely crushes it in automated data science benchmarks, potentially pushing data science toward full automation. üß† ['Paper Link'](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10974)
3.  **ChineseHarm-Bench** has been launched by researchers to tackle the scarcity of resources for Chinese harmful content detection! This comprehensive, professionally annotated **benchmark for Chinese harmful content detection** is built entirely on real-world data and includes a **knowledge rule base** to help large language models with detection. The study also introduced a **knowledge-enhanced baseline** that lets smaller models perform just as well as advanced large language models in Chinese harmful content detection, significantly boosting the efficiency and accuracy of Chinese content moderation. üõ°Ô∏è ['Paper Link'](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10960)
4.  **VideoDeepResearch** has rolled out an innovative **agent framework** to face the challenge of Long Video Understanding (LVU) for current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)! It tackles LVU tasks by just combining a pure-text **large inference model** with a **modular multimodal toolkit**. This framework strategically uses tools to access video content, smashing existing MLLM performance in multiple long video understanding benchmarks and proving the huge potential of **agent systems** in conquering tough LVU challenges. üé¨ ['Paper Link'](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10821)

### **AI Industry Outlook & Social Impact**
1.  Over 80% of `ByteDance` engineers are using **AI-assisted development**, signaling that programmers' value is shifting from just **writing code** to higher-level **system design**, **problem modeling**, and **human-machine collaboration**. **AI programming tools** aren't just boosting efficiency; they're set to enable a future where "**everyone can code**," totally redefining the essence of programming and the right to participate in the digital society. üßë‚Äçüíª <br/> ![Image](https://cdn.jsdmirror.com/gh/justlovemaki/imagehub@main/images/2025/07/news_01k024kr8gf5p86nygyxmcrfcm.avif) <br/>
2.  `Disney and Universal Pictures` are teaming up to sue **AI company Midjourney**, accusing it of illegally using copyrighted content to train its models and generate well-known characters. Their goal? To establish a **licensing mechanism for AI use**. This marks Hollywood's first official dive into generative AI legal disputes, and the outcome will deeply impact the global legal frameworks and business models for AI content generation. ‚öñÔ∏è <br/> ![Image](https://cdn.jsdmirror.com/gh/justlovemaki/imagehub@main/images/2025/07/news_01k024kv0pfvtb0vp6e83gp6yt.avif) <br/>
