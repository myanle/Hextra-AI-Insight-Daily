#### **AI Frontier Research**
1.  **Tencent's AI team** recently released the AI singing model **LeVo**. With its amazing **zero-shot timbre cloning**, **stem generation**, and **high-fidelity music performance**, this model can even rival Suno 4.5, the "Siri" of the AI music world, in several key indicators! Tencent has also generously announced that LeVo will be released in **open source** form, aiming to break down creative barriers and allow more people to easily use AI music, jointly promoting the vigorous development of the **AI music ecosystem**. In the future, everyone will be a "karaoke king"!

A recent study revealed an amazing **memory leap** in **large language models**: **Meta's** latest **Llama 3.1 70B model** can actually "remember" **42% of the content** of the first *Harry Potter* book, which is nearly **ten times** the capability of its previous generation model! This **milestone** not only indicates that AI is rapidly approaching **human cognitive levels** in terms of **deeply understanding and processing text**, but also opens up endless possibilities for us to envision the future of AI capabilities - maybe in the future AI can really read all the books for us! <br/> [![图片](https://autoproxy.justlikemaki.vip/?pp=https://pic.chinaz.com/picmap/202111072153100579_0.jpg)](https://autoproxy.justlikemaki.vip/?pp=https://pic.chinaz.com/picmap/202111072153100579_0.jpg) <br/>
3.  This study proposes a clever method called "**budget guidance**," which can effectively control the **reasoning length** of a **large language model** without fine-tuning it, as if "limiting" the model's thinking, thereby significantly **reducing reasoning costs** while maintaining or even improving performance. The method has shown up to a **26% improvement in accuracy** in mathematical benchmark tests, and can effectively reduce the consumption of computing resources. More amazingly, it also has **emerging capabilities** such as **estimating the difficulty of problems**, making large models more "cost-effective"! ['Paper Address'](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13752)
