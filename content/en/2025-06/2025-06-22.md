#### **Top Open Source Projects**
1. The Ant Technology team really went all out this time! üöÄ They **open-sourced** the lightweight **MoE inference model Ring-lite**. Although the total parameters of this model are 16.8B, the activated parameters are only 2.75B, which is both lightweight and powerful! With its original **C3PO reinforcement learning training method**, it has achieved SOTA (State-Of-The-Art) results on multiple inference leaderboards, especially in mathematics and programming competitions. Ring-lite realizes full-link transparency for the first time, and generously provides model weights, training code, and datasets, providing valuable resources for related research around the world. üëç
