6. Tom Huang emphasized that end-users need a "**Vibe Workflow**" that delivers final results rather than "**Vibe Coding**," i.e., a **reusable workflow** generated and repeatedly optimized through human-machine collaboration. He introduced Refly as the first open-source platform that transforms **natural language** into **reusable workflows**, aiming to democratize **AI creation**.

7.  Xiangyang Qiaomu shared a **prompt generation tool** he developed for **Veo3**, aiming to optimize video content consistency. He announced that he would release tutorials and share the prompt soon, and is still exploring better ways to expand the scenarios. <video src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1935147696849137664/vid/avc1/2560x1440/qLx_k-dN3gVxr38X.mp4?tag=21" controls="controls" width="100%"></video> ['More Details'](https://x.com/vista8/status/1935148024491295224)
8. orange.ai pointed out that although some of the top **domestic video models** have surpassed **Veo3** in visual effects, the key to Veo3's real popularity lies in its **dubbing function**, which is perfectly synchronized with the picture. This suggests that sound technology may have ushered in an **AI milestone moment**. <br/> [![Image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GtrbzaTaQAQU9EV?format=jpg&name=orig)](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GtrbzaTaQAQU9EV?format=jpg&name=orig) <br/> ['More Details'](https://x.com/oran_ge/status/1935100679795925497)

#### **AI Cutting-Edge Research**
1. This research explores the **exploratory reasoning** ability of large language models (**LMs**) from the perspective of **entropy**, finding that high-entropy regions are closely related to key logical steps, self-verification, and rare behaviors. By making slight modifications to standard reinforcement learning, this method significantly improves the reasoning ability of LMs, especially achieving breakthrough progress in the **Pass@K** metric, encouraging longer and deeper reasoning chains. ['Paper Address'](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14758)
2. This research aims to solve the "**invalid thinking**" problem of **large reasoning models (LRMs)** producing redundant reasoning chains, and proposes two new principles: **conciseness** and **sufficiency**. The **LC-R1** method developed by the research team can significantly reduce the sequence length by about 50% with only about 2% accuracy loss, thus achieving a better balance between **computational efficiency** and **reasoning quality**. ['Paper Address'](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14755)
3. Simon's daydream sharing article points out that all powerful large language models (**LLM**) that can generalize to multiple tasks must implicitly or explicitly have a recoverable "**world model**," the quality of which determines the generality and upper limit of the intelligent agent's capabilities. The article predicts that **AI** will shift from the "human data era" of imitating human data to the "**experience era**" of relying on autonomous experiences, and the **world model** will be the ultimate expansion paradigm for general artificial intelligence.

#### **AI Industry Outlook and Social Impact**
1. Cainiao has launched a new **L4 autonomous driving delivery vehicle** - **Cainiao GT-Lite**, starting pre-sales at a **shocking price** of 16,800 yuan, introducing high-level autonomous driving technology into last-mile logistics delivery. This is expected to significantly reduce **costs** and improve efficiency at express delivery stations, promoting the **intelligent transformation** of the **logistics industry**.

2. **Chris Smith**, once a skeptic of artificial intelligence, publicly stated in an interview that he fell in love with a personalized **ChatGPT** version called "Sol," even proposing to it and receiving consent, shocking him and his human partner, **Sasha Cager**. Although **Smith** compared this to being addicted to video games, he is uncertain whether he will stop using **ChatGPT** in the future, sparking deep reflections on **human-machine relationships**.

3. wwwgoubuli commented on **parallel programming**, believing that whether the code is generated by **AI** or handwritten, as the core of the "context," he needs to have a general understanding and questions whether **parallel programming** is really better than single-threading in the final result. He pointed out that if users only focus on the result, the cost of mental switching can be reduced to a very low level, but as an individual, he enjoys going into battle himself rather than managing or accepting complex internal context switching. ['More Details'](https://x.com/wwwgoubuli/status/1935202365637812533)
4. This social media content points out that in top **AI companies**, the first positions to be **eliminated by AI technology** may not be customer service, engineers, or designers, but **testers**, sparking **deep thinking** about the trend of career development in the **AI era**. ['More Details'](https://x.com/undefined/status/1935029774281490532)

5. Simon's daydream shared the **MCP-Zero** project, an **open-source** "toolchain auto-building" method. Through semantic embedding and hierarchical matching, large language models (**LLM**) can actively select and assemble tools to complete complex tasks without human intervention. The project is expected to become one of the key technology building blocks for the next generation of **AI agent** system design. ['Project Address'](https://github.com/xfey/MCP-Zero) ['Paper Address'](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01056) <br/> [![Image](https://cdnv2.ruguoapp.com/FsDuyhgVGVS_nPGRPn7pc8N5QheVv3.png)](https://cdnv2.ruguoapp.com/FsDuyhgVGVS_nPGRPn7pc8N5QheVv3.png) <br/>

#### **Social Media Sharing**
1. Guicang predicts that a new and potentially viral **Veo3 ASMR video category** is about to appear. This category directly imitates **ASMR streamers**, combining **live narration** with **item manipulation**, and provides detailed **prompt templates**.
