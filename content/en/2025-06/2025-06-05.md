#### **AI Product and Feature Updates**
1.  Suno recently upgraded its **AI music editing tool**, allowing users to upload and remix unfinished tracks. You can now tweak lyrics, extend songs up to eight minutes, and play around with creative sliders and stuff. <br/> [![ÂõæÁâá](https://autoproxy.justlikemaki.vip/?pp=https://pic.chinaz.com/picmap/202406061628284261_1.jpg)](https://autoproxy.justlikemaki.vip/?pp=https://pic.chinaz.com/picmap/202406061628284261_1.jpg) <br/> This update comes as they're facing a copyright lawsuit from major record labels who want to introduce something like **YouTube Content ID** to track music usage on **AI** platforms.
2.  OpenAI just announced some sweet new features for **ChatGPT**, like connecting to external services such as **Outlook**, **Teams**, and **Gmail**. It's all about boosting collaboration and making it easier for businesses to get info. <br/> [![ÂõæÁâá](https://autoproxy.justlikemaki.vip/?pp=https://pic.chinaz.com/picmap/202412271704353969_1.jpg)](https://autoproxy.justlikemaki.vip/?pp=https://pic.chinaz.com/picmap/202412271704353969_1.jpg) <br/> Plus, **macOS** users rocking **ChatGPT Team** now have a "**Recording Mode**" that automatically generates meeting notes and to-do lists.
3.  The AI-powered code editor **Cursor** officially dropped version 1.0, and it's got a killer feature called **BugBot**. It automatically reviews **Pull Requests** on **GitHub** and fixes code with a single click. Boom! <br/> [![ÂõæÁâá](https://autoproxy.justlikemaki.vip/?pp=https://pic.chinaz.com/2025/0605/6388471022950404092684122.png)](https://autoproxy.justlikemaki.vip/?pp=https://pic.chinaz.com/2025/0605/6388471022950404092684122.png) <br/> This version also fully unlocks background proxy features and adds **Jupyter** support and "Memories" project management to seriously crank up developer productivity.
4.  Tencent Charity just rolled out a rad new "**Ask AI**" feature that's bringing **large AI models** to the world of philanthropy for the first time. It's all about making it easier for the public to connect with charity projects and organizations and boosting transparency. <br/> [![ÂõæÁâá](https://autoproxy.justlikemaki.vip/?pp=https://pic.chinaz.com/picmap/201811151633427149_4.jpg)](https://autoproxy.justlikemaki.vip/?pp=https://pic.chinaz.com/picmap/201811151633427149_4.jpg) <br/> This easy communication method should help people understand and get involved in charitable causes more, and hopefully push the whole sector forward.

#### **AI Cutting-Edge Research**
1.  This research introduces the **SuperWriter-Agent** framework, which seriously boosts the coherence and quality of **large language models** when generating long-form text by adding structured thinking, planning, and refinement phases. <br/> The **SuperWriter-LM** model trained using this framework is killing it in benchmark tests, proving that this reflection-driven approach can help models write high-quality, consistent long-form content like a pro: [Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04180).

#### **AI Industry Outlook and Social Impact**
1.  OpenAI CEO **Sam Altman** says that companies are starting to see **AI** as basically entry-level employees. That's why tech companies have been hiring 25% fewer junior positions between 2023 and 2024. <br/> [![ÂõæÁâá](https://autoproxy.justlikemaki.vip/?pp=https://pic.chinaz.com/picmap/202305291455510902_2.jpg)](https://autoproxy.justlikemaki.vip/?pp=https://pic.chinaz.com/picmap/202305291455510902_2.jpg) <br/> Experts are predicting that **AI** could replace as many as 375 million jobs by 2030, and that half of all junior white-collar jobs could vanish in the next 1-5 years, potentially causing a whopping 20% unemployment rate.

#### **Top Open Source Projects**
1.  **HowToCook** is a home cooking guide designed specifically for programmers to help them figure out how to cook. The project already has **87530** **Stars** and is only available in simplified Chinese. It provides detailed cooking instructions: [Link](https://github.com/Anduin2017/HowToCook).
2.  **system-design-primer** is an open-source project aimed at helping you learn how to design large-scale systems and prep for system design interviews. It has earned **304096** **Stars**. It offers comprehensive learning resources and includes **Anki** flashcards to help you study: [Link](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer).
3.  The **ChinaTextbook** project is all about collecting **PDF textbooks** from all levels of education in China‚Äîelementary, middle, high school, and university‚Äîto give students and teachers free educational resources. This super useful database has gotten **35875** **Stars**: [Link](https://github.com/TapXWorld/ChinaTextbook).
4.  Firecrawl just released its game-changing **/search API**, letting developers get both web search and content scraping done with one single API call, with data output in various **AI-friendly** formats. <br/> [![ÂõæÁâá](https://autoproxy.justlikemaki.vip/?pp=https://pic.chinaz.com/2025/0605/6388471694605610854897111.png)](https://autoproxy.justlikemaki.vip/?pp=https://pic.chinaz.com/2025/0605/6388471694605610854897111.png) <br/> This feature seriously streamlines data acquisition for **AI** applications, eliminating the need for third-party stuff, boosting data processing efficiency, and has already snagged over 10K **Stars** on **GitHub**.

#### **Social Media Shares**
1.  **Gorden Sun** shared a set of **AI** prompts that can generate totally awesome picture-text effects and recommends using tools like **GPT4o**, **Claude-3.7**, and **DeepSeek-V3**. <br/> [![Image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Gse1INSb0AQCh0S?format=jpg&name=orig)](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Gse1INSb0AQCh0S?format=jpg&name=orig) <br/> He points out that although these prompts are easy to use, the original creator put a lot of thought into putting them together: [Link](https://x.com/Gorden_Sun/status/1930466986544308552).
2.  Twitter user **wwwyesterday** compared modern academic papers to the **npm** package management system, arguing that both have tons of papers/packages with layer upon layer of citations/dependencies, but most aren't worth much, and only a few classics are widely cited. <br/> He says that it's rare these days for someone to create something entirely from scratch, just like writing code is impossible without `package.json`, but he still scours **arxiv** for new ideas: [Link](https://x.com/wwwgoubuli/status/1930310020312510934).
