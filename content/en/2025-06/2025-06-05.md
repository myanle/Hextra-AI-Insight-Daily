### **AI Product & Feature Updates**
1. Suno just dropped some sweet upgrades to its **AI music editing tool**! 🎶 Now, you can upload and remix your unfinished tracks, tweak lyrics, and even extend songs up to eight minutes, plus they've added cool features like creative sliders. <br/> ![Image](https://cdn.jsdmirror.com/gh/justlovemaki/imagehub@main/images/2025/07/news_01k02500x1fpyr3khes6xk607p.avif) <br/> This update hits as Suno faces copyright lawsuits from major record labels. These labels are pushing for tech similar to **YouTube Content ID** to track music usage on **AI** platforms, so it's a hot topic! 🔥
2. ChatGPT just got a major glow-up! ✨ OpenAI announced that it can now connect with multiple external services like **Outlook**, **Teams**, and **Gmail**. This is all about boosting collaboration and information access for enterprise users. <br/> ![Image](https://cdn.jsdmirror.com/gh/justlovemaki/imagehub@main/images/2025/07/news_01k025043mf1g8ffcy3b3tw4ed.avif) <br/> And get this: **macOS** users on **ChatGPT Team** also snagged a new "recording mode" that auto-generates meeting minutes and to-do lists. Talk about a productivity hack! 🚀
3. Cursor, the AI-powered code editor, just dropped its official 1.0 version! 🤩 It's packing a game-changing core feature called **BugBot**, which can automatically review **GitHub Pull Requests** and even fix code with a single click. <br/> ![Image](https://cdn.jsdmirror.com/gh/justlovemaki/imagehub@main/images/2025/07/news_01k0254gtwep7vf6a3csxwr8rr.avif) <br/> This release also fully opens up the backend proxy feature, adds **Jupyter** support, and introduces "Memories" for project management. Basically, it's designed to seriously supercharge developer productivity. Get ready to code faster! 👨‍💻
4. Tencent Charity just rolled out an innovative new feature called "**Ask AI**"! 🙏 This marks the first time a **large AI model** has been applied to the public welfare sector. Its goal? To boost interaction and transparency between the public and charity projects/organizations. <br/> ![Image](https://cdn.jsdmirror.com/gh/justlovemaki/imagehub@main/images/2025/07/news_01k025116wfdq8dnc7yqkfem0m.avif) <br/> This super convenient communication channel is set to help the public dive deeper into understanding and participating in charitable causes, potentially driving even more growth for the sector. Awesome stuff! 💖

### **Cutting-Edge AI Research**
1. A new study introduces the **SuperWriter-Agent** framework! ✍️ This bad boy significantly boosts the coherence and quality of long-form text generated by **large language models** by bringing in structured thinking, planning, and refinement stages. <br/> **SuperWriter-LM**, trained on this framework, shows leading performance across various benchmarks. This proves that a reflection-driven approach can really get models churning out higher-quality, consistent long-form content, just like a pro writer would! Mind blown! 🤯 [Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04180)

### **AI Industry Outlook & Social Impact**
1. Sam Altman, OpenAI's CEO, recently pointed out something kinda wild: companies are increasingly seeing **AI** as entry-level staff. 😲 This has led to a 25% drop in junior position hiring at tech companies between 2023 and 2024. <br/> ![Image](https://cdn.jsdmirror.com/gh/justlovemaki/imagehub@main/images/2025/07/news_01k0251508fr9rxmvazzj7adp5.avif) <br/> Experts are predicting that **AI** could replace up to 375 million jobs by 2030. Worse, within the next 1 to 5 years, it might even wipe out half of all junior white-collar roles, potentially causing unemployment rates to spike up to 20%. Wild times ahead, folks! 😬

### **Top Open Source Projects**
1. **HowToCook** is here to save hungry developers! 🧑‍🍳 This project is a home cooking guide specifically designed for programmers, aiming to solve that universal "can't cook" struggle. It's already snagged **87,530 Stars** on GitHub and offers super detailed cooking instructions, though it's currently only available in Simplified Chinese. Pretty cool, right? 😎 [Link](https://github.com/Anduin2017/HowToCook)
2. Ready to ace those system design interviews? 📈 **system-design-primer** is an open-source project built to help you learn how to design large-scale systems. It's pulled in a whopping **304,096 Stars**! This project hooks you up with comprehensive learning resources, plus it even includes **Anki** flashcards to make studying a breeze. Seriously helpful stuff! ✨ [Link](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer)
3. The **ChinaTextbook** project is doing some seriously awesome work! 📚 It's all about collecting **PDF textbooks** from every primary school, junior high, high school, and university across China, providing free educational resources for students and teachers alike. This super practical database has already racked up **35,875 Stars**. Talk about a win for education! 🌟 [Link](https://github.com/TapXWorld/ChinaTextbook)
4. Firecrawl just dropped a groundbreaking **/search API**! 🔥 This bad boy lets developers perform web searches and content extraction with just a single API call, outputting data in various **AI-friendly** formats. <br/> ![Image](https://cdn.jsdmirror.com/gh/justlovemaki/imagehub@main/images/2025/07/news_01k0254jebfeab6z4qw7s6bjef.avif) <br/> This feature massively simplifies data acquisition for **AI** applications, ditching third-party dependencies and seriously boosting data processing efficiency. It's already scored over 10K **Stars** on **GitHub** – talk about hot stuff! 🚀

### **Social Media Snippets**
1. Gorden Sun just dropped some super cool **AI** prompts that can generate "super awesome" image-text effects! ✨ He's recommending tools like **GPT4o**, **Claude-3.7**, and **DeepSeek-V3** to get the job done. <br/> ![Image](https://cdn.jsdmirror.com/gh/justlovemaki/imagehub@main/images/2025/07/news_01k0251tgpfbq82znxasn4pms5.avif) <br/> Gorden also noted that while these prompts are easy to use, the original creator really put in the effort to organize them. Big shoutout to them! 🙌 [Link](https://x.com/Gorden_Sun/status/1930466986544308552)
2. Twitter user **@wwwyesterday** cooked up a pretty wild comparison: modern academic papers are kinda like the **npm** package management system! 🤔 He reckons both suffer from a massive number of papers/packages, with citations/dependencies piling up layer upon layer. Plus, he points out that most aren't super valuable, while only a few classics get widely cited. <br/> He also made a solid point that few people can truly start from scratch these days, just like you can't write code without a `package.json`. Still, he keeps scrolling **arxiv** looking for fresh ideas. Gotta respect that hustle! 💡 [Link](https://x.com/wwwgoubuli/status/1930310020312510934)
