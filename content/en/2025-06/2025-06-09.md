#### **AI Product and Feature Updates**
1. **OpenAI** announced an upgrade to **ChatGPT's** advanced voice features, significantly improving the naturalness and fluency of voice interaction, making its **tone more natural, rhythm more realistic, and emotional expression richer**. It also added a **two-way automatic translation** function that can continuously perform multi-turn dialogue translations without repeated instructions, making it particularly suitable for international travel, remote work, and language learning scenarios.
2. MiniMax launched the **MiniCPM 4.0 series** models on June 6, including an 8B sparse version and a 0.5B lightweight version. In terms of edge-side performance, it achieved a **speed increase of 220 times in extreme cases and 5 times in regular cases**. Through **system-level sparse innovation** and efficient dual-frequency shifting technology, it significantly reduced edge-side storage requirements and has been successfully adapted to mainstream chips such as Intel and Qualcomm.
