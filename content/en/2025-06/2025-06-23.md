### **AI Product & Feature Updates**

1.  Luo Yonghao recently spilled some beans! 🤫 His company is cooking up a brand-new AI product, expected to drop in just two or three months. This isn't just a simple AI email tool; it's a whole suite of super practical productivity tools. Luo even quipped that many US-based AI email tools they tried didn't cut it, and local R&D teams in this space are pretty scarce. As for the juicy details? He's keeping mum, leaving everyone on the edge of their seats! 🤐

2.  Guizang's AI toolbox has been rocking it lately, creating some wild new stuff! 📢 Using their Veo3 tool, they've whipped up a series of animal athlete AI videos that are absolutely blowing up online! 🤩 Seriously, picture kangaroos playing basketball 🏀 and cats fencing 🤺—aren't you just melting from the cuteness? Even better, they generously shared detailed prompt templates so everyone can easily jump in and experience the endless creativity of AI video generation! Wanna know how they did it?

3.  wwwgoubuli is totally raving about Claude, calling its code generation "silky smooth"! ✨ He believes Claude's excellence stems from its superb "global perspective" and "task orchestration" capabilities. It's like giving Large Language Models (LLMs) a "smart navigation system," drastically reducing those awkward moments where they "run wild" during generation. This deep grasp of context truly proves its massive role in boosting AI model output quality! Want to dive deeper? Check out ['More Details'](https://x.com/wwwgoubuli/status/1936501764410445947). 👇

### **Cutting-Edge AI Research**

1.  Nazha just dropped a bombshell! 😮 Tech detective Jack Cable 🕵️‍♂️ successfully reverse-engineered the system prompts of the previously viral cheating tool, Cluely! Even more astonishing, he revealed that the real masterminds behind Cluely are actually GPT 4.1 and Claude Sonnet 3.7! While Cluely tried super hard to hide its dependent LLM providers, this discovery 💡 has totally ripped off its "mask," completely exposing its true tech stack. Want more juicy gossip?

### **AI Industry Outlook & Social Impact**

1.  Orange.ai seriously points out that companies absolutely *must* transition to **AI Native** (AI-first) 🚀! Why, you ask? Because it can send employee efficiency skyrocketing 📈, even though traditional enterprises might face some serious hurdles 🤔 in organizational adaptation. On the flip side, those lean and mean AI startups are crushing it, generating higher revenue with fewer people! This stark contrast definitely signals that in the coming years, **AI Native** organizations will show off some serious vitality in market competition! Want more insights on future businesses?

### **Social Buzz**

1.  Yubo threw out a thought-provoking idea on social media 🤔: He believes that in the **AI era**, our common act of "clipping" (like saving content) has quietly shifted its true meaning! It's no longer just the traditional "watch later"; it's more like a **signal transmission** 💡, implicitly "**telling AI I like it**"! ❤️ This is truly a unique perspective that offers a deeper understanding of digital behavior in the AI era.
