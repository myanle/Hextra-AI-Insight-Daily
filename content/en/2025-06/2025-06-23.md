#### **AI Product and Feature Updates**

1. Luo Yonghao recently **spilled the beans**🤫: his company is working on a **brand-new AI product**, expected to be released in just two or three months! This isn't just some run-of-the-mill AI email tool; it's a super practical **productivity tool suite**. Old Luo even complained that they tried out a bunch of American AI email tools, but the results were lackluster, and there are relatively few domestic R&D teams in this area. As for the specific details of the new product? He's keeping his **lips sealed**, really building up the hype!

2. 📢 So cool! **Guicang's AI toolbox** has been getting really creative lately, using the **Veo3** tool to create a series of wildly popular **AI videos of animal athletes**🤯! Imagine a kangaroo playing basketball🏀, or a cat doing fencing🤺—totally adorable, right? Even better, they're generously sharing detailed **prompt templates** so everyone can easily jump in and experience the boundless creativity of AI video generation! Wanna know how they did it?

3. **wwwgoubuli** is singing **Claude**'s praises, saying its **code generation** is "silky smooth"✨! He believes the key to Claude's excellence lies in its outstanding "holistic view" and "task orchestration" capabilities. It's like giving a large language model (**LLM**) "smart navigation," greatly reducing the awkwardness of them "crashing around" during the generation process. This deep understanding of context really 👍 proves its huge impact on improving the output quality of AI models! Want to learn more?

#### **AI Cutting-Edge Research**

1. 😮 **nazha** has some breaking news! Jack Cable, the tech detective🕵️‍♂️, successfully **reverse-engineered** the **system prompts** of the once-popular cheating tool, **Cluely**! Even more surprising is that he revealed that the real masterminds behind Cluely are **GPT 4.1** and **Claude Sonnet 3.7**! Although Cluely went to great lengths to hide the LLM provider it relies on, this discovery💡 undoubtedly burst its bubble and completely exposed its underlying tech stack. Want more gossip?

#### **AI Industry Outlook and Social Impact**

1. **Orange.ai** emphatically points out that the transition to **AI Native** for companies is absolutely imperative🚀! Why?

This stark contrast undoubtedly predicts that **AI Native** organizations will demonstrate stronger vitality in market competition in the coming years! Want to learn more about future enterprises?
